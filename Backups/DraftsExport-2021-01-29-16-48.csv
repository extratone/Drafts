You fight your superficiality, your shallowness, so as to try to come at people without unreal expectations, without an overload of bias or hope or arrogance, as untanklike as you can be, sans cannon and machine guns and steel plating half a foot thick; you come at them unmenacingly on your own ten toes instead of tearing up the turf with your caterpillar treads, take them on with an open mind, as equals, man to man, as we used to say, and yet you never fail to get them wrong. You might as well have the brain of a tank. You get them wrong before you meet them, while you're  anticipating meeting them; you get them wrong while you're with  them; and then you go home to tell somebody else about the meeting and you get them all wrong again. Since the same generally goes for them with you, the whole thing is really a dazzling illusion empty of all perception, an astonishing farce of misperceptiono And yet what are we to do about this terribly significant business of other people, which gets bled of the significance we think  it has and takes on instead a significance that is ludicrous, so illequipped are we all to envision one another's interior workings and invisible aims? Is everyone to go off and lock the door and sit secluded like the lonely writers do, in a soundproof cell, summoning people out of words and then proposing that these word  people are closer to the real thing than the real people that we mangle with our ignorance every day? The fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway. It's getting them wrong that is living, getting them wrong and wrong and wrong and then, on careful reconsideration, getting them wrong again. That's how we know we're alive: we're wrong. Maybe the best thing would be to forget being right or wrong about people and just go along for the ride. But if you can do that—well, lucky you.","philip roth,quote",0,false,Markdown

relentless, the country keeps
doors and walls reverberate
all but rest in summer’s heat

I remember the dawn and dusk - the open palette, gradiented above
opposite a front
overtaking me, 
on the 4030,
tilling terraces ’round the North 180

growing here is not a war with Earth,
but a chronological board game, 
won by the punctual
and patient

I am neither of these,
but I am fond of a good emergency

and it all plays out for me; 
the torrent released in Missouri haste
big drops turn to steam on the labored muffler 
too much to do;
getting it over with,
God cries in heaves, quickly,
around here

![The Crossing Auditorium](https://i.snap.as/tEE74LR.jpeg) 
## Askeptical spectacle in the day-to-day typhoon of Faith’s modern enterprise. 
The year I was given my first generation iPhone was the last of 14 through which my mother was still comfortable enforcing my obligation to attend Sunday morning church service. She and my stepfather had migrated 18 months or so prior from [Suburban Church of Mediocore Dope Christ-Appropriated Lukewarm Dilluted Prog Rock and The Occasional Teachings of Protestant-ish Side-Glances at The New Testament] to the [*New York Times*-appointed champion](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/movies/how-the-true-false-film-festival-and-a-church-work-together.html) of Columbia Missouri’s [20-Year-Long](https://www.komu.com/news/mega-church-growth/) *Quirk the Church!* Soverignty Crusade: *The Crossing*. Like its competitors (of which my parents’ previous church had ranked quite poorly,) the blatantly death-cult-sounding House of God includes its own artisanal, latte-equipped coffee shop (I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s *actually* a Starbucks affiliate at this point,) a regularly-replenished catering table full of doughnuts immediately to the side as one enters, and a sophisticated childcare operation staffed no less thoroughly than my public elementary school.

Since 2007, the church has been expanding from its first home (as a functional place of worship, anyway,) which lies within 1) line-of-sight from one of [Nancy Walton](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/dance/2013/7/31/nancy-walton-laurie-ballets-next-best-friend.html)’s properties, 2) a mile of the southernmost exit off US-63 - mid-Missouri’s primary North⟺South roadway - and includes a powered pump-arrigated pond, though the majority of the acreage is blackened by pragmatically-arrayed big box store-caliber multi-rowed parking. Ye, by night, it is flooded in coordinately-distributed cold white light suspended by the same uniform steel poles which guard long-term airport lots. Naturally, the entry and exit points for the asphalt spread are arranged deliberately opposed so that four figures’ worth of God’s children may be fed, digested, and evacuated through their weekly appointment with Christ as efficiently and *hassle-free* as possible.

God’s ~white~ children become *especially* sensitive to entirely-trivial delay or other perceieved deviation from Their Expectations when inside an automobile thanks to a rampant misconception that simulataneously allows them a renewed sense of control over their environment. Psychoanalytic observation has suggested it is catalyzed by delusions of physical anonymity, exemption from civic responsibility, and a titanically-inflated perception of their personally misattributed contributions to the perpetuation of the universe. This vehicular component of the customer experience is a fundamental ingredient in *The Crossing*’s stellar member retinenance record - the single metric above all quantifying a Christian organization’s overall effectiveness in accomplishing the faith’s (mostly cross-denominational) evangelistic Prime Directive / General Order Number One as [abridged by Christ himself](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+28%3A18-20&version=NIV) to the Pharisees after his resurrection: “go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of [The Holy Trinity].” I did not take the opportunity to sample *The Crossing*’s baptismal services, but I’m sure sufficient combing of [the church’s Yelp! page](https://yelp.to/qTKq/U3zCk0HlEY) would yield as qualitative an analysis of such a “service” as you could possibly imagine. (Notably, it would appear the “lowest” review is [the singular 4/5 star entry](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-crossing-columbia?hrid=1iW1Q9KCi9WlM3mDzNFvKw&utm_source=ishare).)

I do not mean to disparage *The Crossing*, specifically nor even organized religion, generally, but instead to emphasize the absurdities which have leapt just as readily into what I’d specifically call *The Business* of white protestant Christianity over just the course of my own maturation as it has into any other aspect of our lives. The difference, of course, is the universal set of exceptions - and the particular *age* of said exceptions - which religion maintains, societally. The perspective formed by my own experiences having grown up wholly embedded across the spectrum of white midwestern christianity - including two years of vigorous and quite academic study of the Bible in a tiny private school headquartered in the basement of a Lutheran church - lends to a particular skepticism, amusement, horror, offense, and existential astonishment that latches my fascination into a not-entirely-voluntary hold. 

`Before I go on, I suppose I should also note that it’s been at least two or three years since I last set foot inside the church building at all - my *only* recent experiences/engagement with *The Crossing* has been with their digital content from a relative distance.`

![The Crossing’s Pastors](https://i.snap.as/E5RLm4y.jpeg)
![Apple Leadership Headshots](https://i.snap.as/B8TX5h0.jpeg)

The ludicrous parallels between Apple events and services at *The Crossing*, especially, come immediately to mind every single time I watch one (live or otherwise,) as they did just weeks ago when I first engaged with [this summer’s WWDC keynote](https://youtu.be/psL_5RIBqnY). Pastors [Dave Cover](https://www.thecrossingchurch.com/staff/dave-cover/), [Keith Simon](https://www.thecrossingchurch.com/staff/keith-simon/), and [Shay Roush](https://www.thecrossingchurch.com/staff/shay-roush/) all look, dress, speak, and photograph *exactly* like Steve Jobs, Tim Cook, Scott Foristell, Jony Ive, and just about any [public-facing leadership figure](https://www.apple.com/leadership/) we’ve ever seen giving an Apple Keynote. They’re hilariously interchangeable, as are other explicit aspects of the typical Sunday morning service at *The Crossing*. As far as I can tell, the church as a whole *only* uses Mac computers and the projections in the main auditorium/worship hall - mostly sing-along hymn lyrics and referenced bible verses - are exclusively created through Apple’s office presentation software, Keynote, just as the company itself does for its “Keynotes.” This was immediately obvious to me upon first entering that space because **they both use the default theme** - typography, color palette, transition animations and all. Indeed, during the sermons, the three pastors would take command of the slides by fairly inconspicuously clicking what I’d imagine must be a very sweaty Apple Remote in the *exact* same manner in which Tim Cook and his underlings still do.

**I JUST REMEMBERED DAVE EXPLICITLY USING MENTION OF APPLE PRODUCTS IN HIS SERMONS**
![](FullSizeRender.jpg)
![The Crossing on WordPress](https://i.snap.as/s1Qh8Rz.jpg)

Nay, the likenesses do not diverge when comparing the fundamentals of the two organizations more broadly: *The Business* of the faith is very much a *volume* business, which also describes Apple’s contemporary strategy with perfect precision. It’s been a few years since “[ecosystem](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericjackson/2014/06/03/apple-isnt-a-hardware-or-software-company-its-an-ecosystem-company/)” ceased to be an [exhaustive buzzword](‪https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?hl=en-US&tz=300&date=today+5-y&q=apple+ecosystem&sni=3‬) in tech media discourse, perhaps because the term falls very short in expressing the change in global Apple **scale**. My recollection of high school biology has failed to produce a scientific substitute, but I find Matt Honan’s “[very lovely swamp](https://www.wired.com/2014/09/apple-ecosystem/)” exceptionally said.

#### by [David Blue](http://www.twitter.com/neoyokel)

![Googleplex](https://i.snap.as/tCRNZM7.jpg)

## What I have long predicted is now coming to pass: Google believes it should assume control.

Out of all the technology companies that have made my knees knock and my voice hoarse and my [Tweets manic](http://bit.ly/bluegoogle) as a technoheretic in the past several years, Jumbo Google would easily take home the winning trophy for Dystopian of the Millennium. I have been rehearsing an especially dear pet prophecy of mine, unsolicited, to family, friends, and podcast guests since 2011 in which I end up arguing quite convincingly that Google is a dead ringer for the 16th-century Vatican: an inherently self-isolating organization with an absolute monopoly yielding *gargantuan* levels of essentially passive income from a service which nearly everybody transacts with, but only Google understands (and is therefore assumed to be its only possible provider,) which inevitably develops such a distance from the rest of the populace and their way of life (in tandem with total notoriety and celebrity among them all) not intentionally out of malice, but from the delusion of mythically-bestowed philanthropic duty that is borned of and compounded by this economic and cultural isolation in a perpetual accumulation of power and wealth that radicalizes the monopolizers — the majority already highly predisposed to zeal as they would’ve needed to be in order to find themselves in this singular, universally powerful position over every other class — and leaves their egocentric minds to wander exempt from all criticism save for that of fellow radicalized monopolizers, who together begin to feel more and more comfortable wondering aloud about themselves in increasingly fantastic presumptions: *what if all of this was bestowed upon us because we are superior to them? What if it is our* **divine responsibility** *as superior beings to take charge and shepherd the common people as our sheep — for they cannot possibly know as well as we what is truly best for them?*

You see it, right? And you can feel a very specific flavor of terror that is both awed by the scale of the circumstances created by so few human minds and sincerely amused by the absoluteness of your own inability to alter them in any way. Perhaps you even recognize this taste as one perfected by Christianity’s ancient advertising business, but Google knows so much about you that it’s rumored to’ve been selling user data *to* the Judeochristian God for some time now at a 10% discount, and so we extrapolate and anticipate, yes?

Of course, it’s admittedly satisfying for me to deliver you to this godfearing place in the most perverse *look what I saw first that you didn’t see because you’re just not as bright but lucky for you, I’m so fucking generous with my wisdom* sort of thinking around which the entire personas and livelihoods of fringe movement fanatics are built upon, but this is my *one* thing, okay? I’ve been waiting years for the right time to formally argue this theory in depth, and — thanks to this year’s public spotlight finally pivoting on the giants who’ve been silently swallowing their competition and relentlessly forcing their already ridiculous margins higher and higher in relative obscurity for decades, the time has come, indeed. The common people’s trust in Google had a godawful week.

## Don’t Be Evil

On Monday, [*Gizmodo*](https://gizmodo.com/google-employees-resign-in-protest-against-pentagon-con-1825729300)[ reported](https://gizmodo.com/google-employees-resign-in-protest-against-pentagon-con-1825729300) that twelve frustrated Google employees were quitting the company in protest of their work assisting the Department of Defense to “implement machine learning to classify images gathered by drones” for the detail fleeting Project Maven, despite some [4000 employee signatures](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/technology/google-letter-ceo-pentagon-project.html) on a [letter](http://extratone.com/library/dearsundar.pdf) addressed to CEO Sundar Pichai requesting (in full) that he “cancel this project immediately,” and “draft, publicize, and enforce a clear policy stating that neither Google nor its contractors will ever build warfare technology,” citing the infamous “Don’t Be Evil” motto, which Google [**then proceeded to remove**](https://gizmodo.com/google-removes-nearly-all-mentions-of-dont-be-evil-from-1826153393) from its [code of conduct](https://web.archive.org/web/20180504211806/https://abc.xyz/investor/other/google-code-of-conduct.html) for the first time in 18 years **the day after** the *New York Times* article went to press, on April 5th.

On initial approach to the abstract of this story, from the ass to our thoughts arrives an easy narrative of a Silicon Valley mutiny comprised of twelve brave, conscientious souls who’ve been eaten up inside by their complicity in the filthy deals made by their power-obsessed CEO over scotch and cigars in a dark D.C. study — kept awake for months by the sound of his puffing cackles at satellite images of dead toddlers in a bombed-out street.

*Ah ha*, we say. *That man is no good, and he just wouldn’t listen! They knew they didn’t have a choice… They only did what they had to do…*

The reality of internal disagreements at Google, though, manages to be even more theatrical. The sheer volume of correspondence must surely be beyond anything capable of the enduser’s imagination, so let’s phone a friend: my favorite peek into the day-to-days of inter-Google existence is an [old blog post](http://bentilly.blogspot.com/2010/01/things-ive-learned-at-google.html) by [Benjamin Tilly](https://twitter.com/btilly) on his first month at the company in which he was compelled almost immediately to describe in great detail how best to “deal with a lot of email in gmail” at peak efficiency using shortcuts and labels.
“As you get email, you need to be aggressive about deciding what you need to see, versus what is context specific.”

Now we have a bit better idea of the *aggressive emailing* that was a sure constant on a normal workday at Google in 2010, so it must’ve been deafening after 8 years of Gmail development as 4000 employees no doubt vented, debated, and decided to organize last month, though without making much headway because the leadership’s response was apparently “complicated by the fact that Google claims it is only providing open-source software to Project Maven,” this new knowledge having *significant* effect on our mind’s image of Sundar Pichai’s activities in Washington: he is now swapping seats with a frustrated Colin Powell in order to install OpenOffice onto his desktop from a flash drive, and we recall that Google’s Googleplex headquarters resembles nowhere in modern life more than a brand new playground built in a design language borrowing heavily from *Spy Kids*. And though these Twelve disciples are unnamed for the moment, a few of them could immediately land book deals by going public, and every single one would always have by default not only the badge of “I landed a job at Google,” (which is really to say *I have hit Life’s maximum level cap*,) but “I worked at Google for a while, but ended up quitting to do something else,” which is guaranteed to make you the most interesting, intellectually superior person present in *whatever* crowd for the rest of your life. The ultra-cool [Sarah Cooper](https://twitter.com/sarahcpr) quit Google to become a comedian and even [got to talk to Kara Swisher](https://www.recode.net/2018/1/10/16871786/sarah-cooper-comedian-google-dick-costolo-kara-swisher-recode-decode-podcast)!
I won’t pretend to understand big tech’s diminutive bastardization of prestige, but “more than 90 academics” jumping to publish an [open letter](https://www.icrac.net/open-letter-in-support-of-google-employees-and-tech-workers/) (adjacent to a huge *DONATE: Support the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots* button) in which they “write in solidarity with the 3100+ Google employees” who’s terrible boss decided to help some lackeys in the Pentagon set up their email and didn’t text back for a whole hour doesn’t sound 100% sincere. Notably, I don’t know how *or why* the fuck 90 people would go about collaborating on a single document, but if it really was managed, they definitely used Google Docs…
At one point, it was fun to think about the history of the friendly side-scroller-playing garage ghouls and dorm dorks who gave *cooky*, *wacko* names to their dot com startups in parody and defiance of the lame-ass surname anagrams on the buildings of their established competitors, but those who’ve stuck around have only done so by becoming expert at SUCKING UP EVERYTHING around them, and it pisses me off every day how worried I am that my species will finally be done in by a company with a name like Yahoo! and be known only to a bunch of adolescent interdimensional silicon blobs 30 million years in the future as *that bipedal race who remained dignified until the last 0.01% of their reign on Earth, when in way less than a single generation, they all just went* **FUCKING INSANE** *and blew themselves up because they suddenly hated all sense.*

“Google” is perhaps the worst of these to have to shout in fear and/or anger in your last moments as it sounds in American English like you’ve startled your subject with a ticklish pinch followed so immediately by an esophagus-busting chokehold that the two events appear simultaneous, and in real English English, it almost always sounds like a parent speaking of a character on a pre-K children’s television programme whom they find quite foul and upsetting, but will manage to refrain from expressing so otherwise because they know that *Teletubbies* shit is the most quickly forgotten stage of television viewership. It’s fascinating how exclusive the word “Google” is to American English because in everything else it really *is* complete nonsense, but lets halt all etymological discussions right now because we’ve only now just finished with Monday.

## The Soul Ledger

On Thursday, all of my Google experiences, suppositions, and [soul-detaching screenshots](https://twitter.com/FickleCrux/status/914767928456749056) were usurped when a thoroughly alarming internal company video called [*The Selfish Ledger*](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/17/17344250/google-x-selfish-ledger-video-data-privacy) was leaked to *The Verge,* which I watched once then and do not want to watch again for the sake of this piece, but I will. Though the big V has been disappointingly timid for years about editorializing — when tech journalism desperately needs some confident, informed opinion more than ever — Vlad Savov’s accompanying article should be read in its entirety, to which I can add my own terror where he perhaps could not.
The production style is technically identical to that of the very popular thinkpiece-esque, motion-graphics-paired-with-obligatory-sharpie illustrated videos which you find playing at max volume on your mom’s iPad from where she’s fallen asleep on the couch at 9PM, but the repeating stock string soundtrack multiplies one’s discomfort as such that we would all end up in the fetal position without remembering the transition were it not for the appearance of trusty old Dank Jenkins, who’s face I thankfully associate heavily enough with [his infamous ](https://twitter.com/richarddawkins/status/389432783304548352)[*down-and-out*](https://twitter.com/richarddawkins/status/389432783304548352)[ Tweet](https://twitter.com/richarddawkins/status/389432783304548352) to be a welcome respite in attention before the very scary hypothesis for which it’s been buttering me up, as best summed by Vlad:

> The system would be able to “plug gaps in its knowledge and refine its model of human behavior” — not just your particular behavior or mine, but that of the entire human species. “By thinking of user data as multigenerational,” explains Foster, “it becomes possible for emerging users to benefit from the preceding generation’s behaviors and decisions.” Foster imagines mining the database of human behavior for patterns, “sequencing” it like the human genome, and making “increasingly accurate predictions about decisions and future behaviors.”

The next time the *what if they do something scary* question comes up in a casual conversation about Google, you’ll have something a lot more substantial than just speculation. Or will you? *The Verge* reached out for comment and got an awfully convenient response.

> This is a thought-experiment by the Design team from years ago that uses a technique known as ‘speculative design’ to explore uncomfortable ideas and concepts in order to provoke discussion and debate.

Wow! Leave it up to grand ole Googe to reveal the ultimate excuse for just about any suggestion or behavior, though it does seem almost *deliberately* uncomfortable, doesn’t it? No matter — whether or not this video was ever about a project or tangible product development, or simply to *explore uncomfortable ideas* because it is proof that the company has reached that critical Vatican stage — if you’ll remember — where they now feel comfortable *exploring* Very Bad, but Very easily made Real Ideas amongst themselves about what would happen if they allowed their system to *nudge its users* around a different, slightly less optimal route to the bar, let’s say — without their knowledge — in order for the system to collect traffic data for the sake of its own interests? Which would be, technically, in the interest of all Ledger users now and in the future, so why not?

> The ledger could be given a focus, shifting it from a system which not only tracks our behavior, but offers direction towards a desired result.”

This, my dear privacy-obsessed friends, is the *real issue* with data collection — its power over huge groups by way of their behavior and it is *never* going to be remedied in any significant way by ad-blockers or VPNs because the EndUser shall always out number you 50 to 1, even decades from now. EndUser does not understand — or, crucially, *have any desire* to understand anything technical about what leads to the PewDiePie videos playing on his filthy screen. Here’s a great opportunity to escape Silicon Valley’s technolibertarianism and resign your Darwinian empathy in favor of meaningful and truly-effective action: if you want to avoid a future Google Church (or Google Government, more worryingly,) you should invest your time, effort, and knowledge into electing officials more capable of understanding and regulating Big Tech.

## Google Government

The internet as it stands is made possible by Google as *the* goto resource for online advertising. In 2016, “Google held 75.8 percent of the search ad market, bringing in $24.6 billion in revenue from search ads,” [according to ](https://www.recode.net/2017/3/14/14890122/google-search-ad-market-share-growth)[*Recode*](https://www.recode.net/2017/3/14/14890122/google-search-ad-market-share-growth). By 2019, “that’s expected to grow to $36.62 billion in revenue, or 80.2 percent of the market.” Google’s edge in user behavior and targeted advertising combined with their extensive resources available developers to integrate independent platforms with Google’s software services at various levels makes it very difficult for any advertising-funded individual or organization to compete online without dipping in to the Google universe. YouTube — a Google property since 2006 — has actively invested in and supported a new career path entirely within their own platform that is rapidly becoming [popularly aspired-to by young children](https://metro.co.uk/2018/01/19/children-now-more-likely-to-want-to-become-youtubers-than-actors-7241396/), while the reality of existence as a full-time YouTuber is [far less glamorous](https://medium.com/@robertoblake/what-nobody-tells-you-about-being-a-youtuber-the-youtube-middle-class-378b77eb8bc9) than the immediately-visible surface would indicate, and the effort already expended by my generation in its pursuit has already [made us insane](http://bit.ly/searchchildren).

<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" data-lang=""en"" data-dnt=""true"" data-link-color=""#00006b""><p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">thanks google. <a href=""https://t.co/1jRtrD77R3"">pic.twitter.com/1jRtrD77R3</a></p>&mdash; David Blue (@NeoYokel) <a href=""https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/914767928456749056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">October 2, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script>

So, what would the internet look like if Google didn’t exist? We know they’ve been working with the government now on various projects, but what if some terrible exposed transgression of theirs suddenly warranted an immediate shutdown and seizure of all Google properties? Well, we know from [a post on Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-Google-were-to-shut-down-for-30-minutes) by Googler Ashish Kedia that even 5 years ago, the sudden absence of Google for “2–3 mins” set the internet into a bit of a panic, reducing overall traffic by 40%. In the time since, we’ve all grown exponentially more dependent on Google properties: billions of people rely on Google Maps for directions and, thousands of companies (including the Pentagon and other government institutions) rely on Gmail and GSuites for intercommunication, file sharing, task management, etc., and more and more academic institutions rely on Chromebook devices running connection-dependent operating systems. It’s not much of a stretch to argue that Google’s sudden disappearance would constitute a Civil Emergency in the United States, which will only become a stronger and more serious incentive for regulatory bodies to look the other way.

Though the tangible results of advertising have been quantified significantly in the past 20 years, one can’t help but wonder after watching YouTube ads for the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class on toy unboxing videos if the companies who spend big bucks on Google advertising understand where their money is going, but they know that if they *don’t* advertise there, their competitors will. This, of course, is a fundamental practice of a monopoly, and it’s yielded Google so much fucking money that they cannot possibly spend it fast enough, as evidenced by [their investments in life extension](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/4/27/15409672/google-calico-secretive-aging-mortality-research) — so that, perhaps, they will have more time on Earth to figure it out.

When you build a collection of the world’s smartest people in a [self-sufficient environment](https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/googles-monastic-vision-for-the-future-of-work) that discourages exploration of other lifestyles and ideas, and you sustain the society with a gargantuan, relatively low-maintenance revenue stream, you create a culture which is not only well-primed for isolationism, but is also extremely inefficient. In fact, with its [vast collection of abandoned products and properties](https://www.computerworlduk.com/galleries/it-vendors/google-graveyard-3508070/), Google must surely be one of the most inefficient companies in history. Thinking back on recent software releases along with its [recent entries into the hardware space](https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/4/16405184/rick-osterloh-interview-new-google-hardware-vision-htc-deal), Google is also one of the worst competing tech companies. Very little aside from Gmail, Google Photos, Google Maps, and Chrome have found their place or garnered significant usership. Google Play Music is unintuitive and impossible, Google Allo and Google+ are all but forgotten addendums to other services, and Google Search — its core, original function — has been [out of control](https://theoutline.com/post/1430/google-finally-realized-that-racist-search-results-are-a-problem) for years, and all of them are designed blandly and excruciatingly tiring to look at.

## Google Shun

If this all has stirred nothing more in you than a desire to eliminate Google from your own online life as much as possible, there *are* alternatives in almost every one of the sphere’s they dominate. As of late, [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/about) has accumulated a fair amount of [buzz and coverage](https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/may/19/google-facebook-security-data-duckduckgo) as a private, more relevant alternative to Google’s plain old search engine. Though it is clever enough to list us as the first result for “extratone,” I’ve found it simply insufficient as a replacement in my own life because, essentially, it rarely delivers what I’m looking for. By contrast, [Dropbox Paper](http://dropbox.com/paper) is such an elegant cloud notetaking and word processing software that it makes Google Docs look simply idiotic (and warrants its own review very shortly.) For getting around, know that [MapQuest](https://www.mapquest.com) is not only [still around](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/does-mapquest-still-exist-as-a-matter-of-fact-it-does/2015/05/22/995d2532-fa5d-11e4-a13c-193b1241d51a_story.html) — it’s now a very competitive mobile navigation app.

I, myself, have allowed Google as complete of access to my information and behavior as possible because I believe “privacy” is a completely futile endeavor if one wishes to be a part of society, though I do often use alternatives to Google services simply because I *fucking hate* the way they look. If you want a more complete list of services and software that allow one to shun the Google God entirely, you’ll be forced to seek out less dignified sources like [*Lifehacker*](https://lifehacker.com/5876794/going-google-free-the-best-alternatives-to-google-services-on-the-web) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/antigoogle/) and decide if the additional time you’ll spend using most of them to accomplish the same tasks is really worth your digital angst.

If Google were to be more explicit with its users and staff about its aspirations to take over control of our lives, there will be little to do but accept the future they intend to create because they’ve long been too powerful to control. In the meantime, I’d suggest you continue to use whatever software works best for you and refrain from wasting your time fretting on conspiratorial suppositions of what the tech industry may be doing to “invade your privacy,” because there is no longer any such thing, nor will there be ever again. However, I would also urge to you worship your own Gods, whomever they may be, for Google will never be worthy. I, for one, shall only pray to our Mother Sun.

Yes, I am still managing to waste my time digging up and re-arranging some *very* old content, but I just couldn't resist. Somehow, it didn't occur to me until yesterday evening that I could sort through the original video files of my old vines fairly easily in fucking Google Photos and blast them through iMovie for iOS into a full montage relatively easily. 

Some of these are very cringey...

The year I was given my first generation iPhone was the last of 14 through which my mother was still comfortable enforcing my obligation to attend Sunday morning church service. She and my stepfather had migrated 18 months or so prior from [Suburban Church of Mediocre Dope Christ-Appropriated Lukewarm Diluted Prog Rock and The Occasional Teachings of Protestant-ish Side-Glances at The New Testament] to the [*New York Times*-appointed champion](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/movies/how-the-true-false-film-festival-and-a-church-work-together.html) of Columbia Missouri’s [20-Year-Long](https://www.komu.com/news/mega-church-growth/) *Quirk the Church!* Sovereignty Crusade: *The Crossing*. Like its competitors (of which my parents’ previous church had ranked quite poorly,) the blatantly death-cult-sounding House of God includes its own artisanal, latte-equipped coffee shop (I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s *actually* a Starbucks affiliate at this point,) a regularly-replenished catering table full of doughnuts immediately to the side as one enters, and a sophisticated childcare operation staffed no less thoroughly than my public elementary school.

Since 2007, the church has been expanding from its first home (as a functional place of worship, anyway,) which lies within 1) line-of-sight from one of [Nancy Walton](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/dance/2013/7/31/nancy-walton-laurie-ballets-next-best-friend.html)’s properties, 2) a mile of the southernmost exit off US-63 - mid-Missouri’s primary North⟺South roadway - and includes a powered pump-arrigated pond, though the majority of the acreage is blackened by pragmatically-arrayed big box store-caliber multi-rowed parking. Ye, by night, it is flooded in coordinately-distributed cold white light suspended by the same uniform steel poles which guard long-term airport lots. Naturally, the entry and exit points for the asphalt spread are arranged deliberately opposed so that four figures’ worth of God’s children may be fed, digested, and evacuated through their weekly appointment with Christ as efficiently and *hassle-free* as possible.

God’s ~white~ children become *especially* sensitive to entirely-trivial delay or other perceived deviation from Their Expectations when inside an automobile thanks to a rampant misconception that simultaneously allows them a renewed sense of control over their environment. Psychoanalytic observation has suggested it is catalyzed by delusions of physical anonymity, exemption from civic responsibility, and a titanically-inflated perception of their personally misattributed contributions to the perpetuation of the universe. This vehicular component of the customer experience is a fundamental ingredient in *The Crossing*’s stellar member retention record - the single metric above all quantifying a Christian organization’s overall effectiveness in accomplishing the faith’s (mostly cross-denominational) evangelistic Prime Directive / General Order Number One as [abridged by Christ himself](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+28%3A18-20&version=NIV) to the Pharisees after his resurrection: “go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of [The Holy Trinity].” I did not take the opportunity to sample *The Crossing*’s baptismal services, but I’m sure sufficient combing of [the church’s Yelp! page](https://yelp.to/qTKq/U3zCk0HlEY) would yield as qualitative an analysis of such a “service” as you could possibly imagine. (Notably, it would appear the “lowest” review is [the singular 4/5 star entry](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-crossing-columbia?hrid=1iW1Q9KCi9WlM3mDzNFvKw&utm_source=ishare).)

I do not mean to disparage *The Crossing*, specifically nor even organized religion, generally, but instead to emphasize the absurdities which have leapt just as readily into what I’d specifically call *The Business* of white protestant Christianity over just the course of my own maturation as it has into any other aspect of our lives. The difference, of course, is the universal set of exceptions - and the particular *age* of said exceptions - which religion maintains, societally. The perspective formed by my own experiences having grown up wholly embedded across the spectrum of white midwestern Christianity - including two years of vigorous and quite academic study of the Bible in a tiny private school headquartered in the basement of a Lutheran church - lends to a particular skepticism, amusement, horror, offense, and existential astonishment that latches my fascination into a not-entirely-voluntary hold. 

(Before I go on, I suppose I should also note that it’s been at least two or three years since I last set foot inside the church building at all - my *only* recent experiences/engagement with *The Crossing* has been with their digital content from a relative distance.)

![The Crossing’s Pastors](https://i.snap.as/E5RLm4y.jpeg)
![Apple Leadership Headshots](https://i.snap.as/B8TX5h0.jpeg)

The ludicrous parallels between Apple events and services at *The Crossing*, especially, come immediately to mind every single time I watch one (live or otherwise,) as they did just weeks ago when I first engaged with [this summer’s WWDC keynote](https://youtu.be/psL_5RIBqnY). Pastors [Dave Cover](https://www.thecrossingchurch.com/staff/dave-cover/), [Keith Simon](https://www.thecrossingchurch.com/staff/keith-simon/), and [Shay Roush](https://www.thecrossingchurch.com/staff/shay-roush/) all look, dress, speak, and photograph *exactly* like Steve Jobs, Tim Cook, Scott Foristell, Jony Ive, and just about any [public-facing leadership figure](https://www.apple.com/leadership/) we’ve ever seen giving an Apple Keynote. They’re hilariously interchangeable, as are other explicit aspects of the typical Sunday morning service at *The Crossing*. As far as I can tell, the church as a whole *only* uses Mac computers and the projections in the main auditorium/worship hall - mostly sing-along hymn lyrics and referenced bible verses - are exclusively created through Apple’s office presentation software, Keynote, just as the company itself does for its “Keynotes.” This was immediately obvious to me upon first entering that space because **they both use the default theme** - typography, color palette, transition animations and all. Indeed, during the sermons, the three pastors would take command of the slides by fairly inconspicuously clicking what I’d imagine must be a very sweaty Apple Remote in the *exact* same manner in which Tim Cook and his underlings still do.

**I JUST REMEMBERED DAVE EXPLICITLY USING MENTION OF APPLE PRODUCTS IN HIS SERMONS**

![The Crossing on WordPress](https://i.snap.as/s1Qh8Rz.jpg)

Nay, the likenesses do not diverge when comparing the fundamentals of the two organizations more broadly: *The Business* of the faith is very much a *volume* business, which also describes Apple’s contemporary strategy with perfect precision. It’s been a few years since “[ecosystem](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericjackson/2014/06/03/apple-isnt-a-hardware-or-software-company-its-an-ecosystem-company/)” ceased to be an [exhaustive buzzword](‪https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?hl=en-US&tz=300&date=today+5-y&q=apple+ecosystem&sni=3‬) in tech media discourse, perhaps because the term falls very short in expressing the change in global Apple **scale**. My recollection of high school biology has failed to produce a scientific substitute, but I find Matt Honan’s “[very lovely swamp](https://www.wired.com/2014/09/apple-ecosystem/)” exceptionally said in 2014, but the fact of the swamp’s becoming generally lovelier in the interim - in a less linear fashion than would have been ideal, mind you - leaves ample room, I think, to fear and respect whatever it was that we then called *The Apple Ecosystem* in 2014 as a **ruling deity or daemon** (just as [Google’s sought to be](https://extratone.com/google-soul-ledger-dont-be-evil), recently.)

I do not mean to disparage *The Crossing*, specifically nor even organized religion, generally, but instead to emphasize the absurdities which have leapt just as readily into what I’d specifically call *The Business* of white protestant Christianity over just the course of my own maturation as it has into any other aspect of our lives. The difference, of course, is the universal set of exceptions - and the particular *age* of said exceptions - which religion maintains, societally. The perspective formed by my own experiences having grown up wholly embedded across the spectrum of white midwestern Christianity - including two years of vigorous and quite academic study of the Bible in a tiny private school headquartered in the basement of a Lutheran church - lends to a particular skepticism, amusement, horror, offense, and existential astonishment that latches my fascination into a not-entirely-voluntary hold. 

(Before I go on, I suppose I should also note that it’s been at least two or three years since I last set foot inside the church building at all - my *only* recent experiences/engagement with *The Crossing* has been with their digital content from a relative distance.)

![The Crossing’s Pastors](https://i.snap.as/E5RLm4y.jpeg)
![Apple Leadership Headshots](https://i.snap.as/B8TX5h0.jpeg)

The ludicrous parallels between Apple events and services at *The Crossing*, especially, come immediately to mind every single time I watch one (live or otherwise,) as they did just weeks ago when I first engaged with [this summer’s WWDC keynote](https://youtu.be/psL_5RIBqnY). Pastors [Dave Cover](https://www.thecrossingchurch.com/staff/dave-cover/), [Keith Simon](https://www.thecrossingchurch.com/staff/keith-simon/), and [Shay Roush](https://www.thecrossingchurch.com/staff/shay-roush/) all look, dress, speak, and photograph *exactly* like Steve Jobs, Tim Cook, Scott Foristell, Jony Ive, and just about any [public-facing leadership figure](https://www.apple.com/leadership/) we’ve ever seen giving an Apple Keynote. They’re hilariously interchangeable, as are other explicit aspects of the typical Sunday morning service at *The Crossing*. As far as I can tell, the church as a whole *only* uses Mac computers and the projections in the main auditorium/worship hall - mostly sing-along hymn lyrics and referenced bible verses - are exclusively created through Apple’s office presentation software, Keynote, just as the company itself does for its “Keynotes.” This was immediately obvious to me upon first entering that space because **they both use the default theme** - typography, color palette, transition animations and all. Indeed, during the sermons, the three pastors would take command of the slides by fairly inconspicuously clicking what I’d imagine must be a very sweaty Apple Remote in the *exact* same manner in which Tim Cook and his underlings still do.

**I JUST REMEMBERED DAVE EXPLICITLY USING MENTION OF APPLE PRODUCTS IN HIS SERMONS**

![The Crossing on WordPress](https://i.snap.as/s1Qh8Rz.jpg)

Nay, the likenesses do not diverge when comparing the fundamentals of the two organizations more broadly: *The Business* of the faith is very much a *volume* business, which also describes Apple’s contemporary strategy with perfect precision. It’s been a few years since “[ecosystem](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericjackson/2014/06/03/apple-isnt-a-hardware-or-software-company-its-an-ecosystem-company/)” ceased to be an [exhaustive buzzword](‪https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?hl=en-US&tz=300&date=today+5-y&q=apple+ecosystem&sni=3‬) in tech media discourse, perhaps because the term falls very short in expressing the change in global Apple **scale**. My recollection of high school biology has failed to produce a scientific substitute, but I find Matt Honan’s “[very lovely swamp](https://www.wired.com/2014/09/apple-ecosystem/)” exceptionally said in 2014, but the fact of the swamp’s becoming generally lovelier in the interim - in a less linear fashion than would have been ideal, mind you - leaves ample room, I think, to fear and respect whatever it was that we then called *The Apple Ecosystem* in 2014 as a **ruling deity or daemon** (just as [Google’s sought to be](https://extratone.com/google-soul-ledger-dont-be-evil), recently.)

> Nearly everything you can do with a photo you can now do with a video. Adjustments, filters, and crop support video editing, so you can rotate, increase exposure, or even apply filters to your videos. Video editing supports all video formats captured on iPhone, including video in 4K at 60 fps and slo-mo in 1080p at 240fps.   
- [ ] Apple’s native Notes app appears completely unchanged to me??? As in... it’s still immediately unusable because of its tacky-ass leather stucco-ish background texture.

### Command Center
- [ ] Though it still drives me absolutely fucking bonkers that the team won’t just use 3D touch to allow users to ~fully~ disable bluetooth and/or wifi from the **Command Center** (or just utilize it more in general,)  the new device/connection selection and shortcut to each protocol’s respective menu in Settings *are* positive steps in a sensible direction. I’m starting to suspect that Apple must surely have some sort of good practice standard which such a feature would violate because even [my own quick-disable shortcut](https://shortcutsgallery.com/shortcuts/turn-off-bluetooth-wifi/) has inexplicably ceased functioning in the past 6 months. :(

![](iOS%2013%20Public%20Beta%20Notes/sharesheetdark.png)

### Notes
Though I was just defending skeuomorphism, I have somehow managed to hate everything about the way iOS’ native Notes app has looked since the very beginning.

### Safari
I’m sad to say, is still far from the most effective browser available on iOS - I decided to swap it back in to slot #1 on my doc, replacing [Firefox](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/firefox-private-safe-browser/id989804926) for the duration of this experience. 
In keeping with that comparison: [Firefox 12 for iOS](https://www.engadget.com/2018/06/12/firefox-12-ios-file-downloads-easier-syncing/) introduced a Downloads manager & folder, “unified link management,” and iCloud sync in February of last year, which left the native Safari at perhaps its lowest point of regard on iPhone. For most of us UX obsessives, it has only been launched in the time since by hyperlinks from the few good apps remaining which still do not offer a default preference to Chrome and/or Firefox. One would imagine, then, that the iOS Safari team has been under substantial internal pressure to deliver a miraculous rework/featureset bent on conquering the hearts of app critics and powerusers once again. Unfortunately, the version I’ve been subjecting myself to  in iOS 13 Beta smells an awful lot like defeatism.

- [ ] Tab switching is still the smoothest-animated, but remains by far the slowest and most crashy of all the mainstream mobile browsers.

- [ ] Unfortunately, it’s quite pitiful when Apple *invents* features months/years after the *alternative* crowd mastered them *on the fringe* with zero disadvantages. There *are* some genuinely-clever additions like **saving open tabs as bookmarks**, and informed folks like *[Gadget Hacks](https://ios.gadgethacks.com/news/20-features-ios-13s-safari-you-wont-want-miss-0198425/)* who’ve described it as “formidable,” yet many of their citations invoke token Apple jokes. *Thank you so much, your majesties, for giving us this new gift of your genius... The Start Page*.

- [ ] The one ever-improving advantage of using native Safari which I think we can all agree on aligns with Apple’s new - and actually quite admirable - **privacy and security-founded brand identity**. (

- [ ] > A new downloads folder gives you a central place to access your web downloads and attachments from Safari and Mail.
### Siri
- [ ] Siri is my favorite voice assistant because she’s by far the biggest idiot of the bunch, yet I’ve found her to *actually* add real functionality to my experience. 
## Keyboard Shortcuts 
- [ ] The new “Quickpath” swiping keyboard makes zero sense as a feature add at this point, but okay Craig.
- [ ] Fucking **VALIDATED** by the attention to keyboard shortcuts (most of the big-deal PadOS’ new shortcuts seem to have been tossed in the iPhone too. God Bless.) Very nice of Craig Apple... I am the only iPhone user in history who has (and continues to) ever made use of this feature more than once. (I didn’t have a laptop in Community College so I just fooled around in Evernote, hunched over my little iPhone 4S to reach the fucking thing.)
*Specifically* though... I can’t find any direct mention of it in Apple’s current preview documentation, but Command-Space shows/hides **Spotlight**, which is the only way to switch between apps without the touchscreen (I can’t seem to find a definite answer on whether or not Command-Tab ever functionally switch applications on iPhone, but I think I would remember it.) This function has always been just clunky enough to interrupt a good workflow.
For instance, let’s say I needed to switch from this very document in Bear to YouTube in order to grab a hyperlink to a [quick demo capture](https://youtu.be/Yt5lPqn2i6M). Here’s what my keystrokes would look like:
`Command Space y o u tab enter`
<a href='IMG_9033.MP4'>IMG_9033.MP4</a>
- [ ]  The various performance updates might seem like a bonus to some, but those of us who’ve been paying attention (out of need or curiosity) to the *absolutely absurd* size of regular app updates to date find the rework of software packages in iOS 13  (claimed 50% smaller App Store packages and 60% smaller updates) to be nothing more than a monstrously-late address to conclude *years* of gross negligence. (Remember we’re talking about the world’s richest company, here... There is no excuse for anything but perfection.)

## General UI
- [ ] Admittedly, it did not occur to me just how stale iOS’ audio/ringer volume indicator had become until I first hit a hardware button while running 13 and marveled at the newfound consideration of use exhibited by Apple’s placement of the new element where it belonged 12 years ago.

I usually suggest practicing force-touching apps directly on the homescreen to prompt the quick function/share menu without fear of inordinate consequences

- [ ] I could be losing my mind, but I’m almost positive an twisting animation has been added when switching apps/returning to the homescreen.

Every year since the first generation iPhone’s announcement in 2007, I have made it a tradition to watch the entirety of the World Wide Developer Conference’s opening keynote regardless of how disappointed I’ve expected to be since iOS 7 - the [post-Steve, post-skeuomorphic overhaul](https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/18/4741724/ios-7-review) used to justify the silent deletion of a few favorite features which I received as a cruel, deeply personal betrayal because my relationship with iPhone and iOS is both deeply personal and pretentiously complex. I have done my best to address this truth with brevity in preface to [everything I've written about iOS so far](https://extratone.com/tag:ios) in hopes that I can contribute substantially to related discourse from a unique perspective. (At this point, it would probably be more reasonable if I just created a static disclaimer/explainer document, but standardization remains the *last possible thing* technology writing needs m[ore]() of.) If you've arrived seeking a more contemporarily-arranged article about iOS 13, you might consider [my unedited notes for this piece](http://bit.ly/13beta) to be a sort of haphazard bibliography. (I'd also love to read your comments there on Dropbox Paper.)Part of this tradition since [WWDC 2013’s introduction of iOS 7](https://youtu.be/gmn4ve4oTL8), naturally, is the dissemination of the Keynote presentations themselves.

But part of what made Apple the Apple we know in the post-1997 era is that when Jobs was at the helm, all design decisions were going through someone with great taste. Not perfect taste, but great taste. But the other part of what made Jobs such a great leader is that he could recognize bad decisions, sooner rather than later, and get them fixed.

<p>When I purchased iPad Pro 11&quot;, I immediately bought the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JZYSTNR/?tag=nahumck-20"">Smart Keyboard Folio</a> (SKF, as I refer to it).<sup id=""fnref-1622-first""><a href=""#fn-1622-first"" class=""jetpack-footnote"">1</a></sup> At the time, this was the best – and only – keyboard option made specifically for the iPad Pro. I needed something that wasn&apos;t heavy, something portable, and something versatile. Over time, some of those needs have changed, and I&apos;ve added a few more use cases that might not be best satisfied by the SKF. So when the Brydge Pro keyboards were announced, I was intrigued about the possibility of that option. I reached out to the team at Brydge, who were kind enough to send me an <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MTSF94C/?tag=nahumck-20"">11&quot; Brydge Pro keyboard</a> review unit to try out.</p>
<p>The unboxing experience is very akin to Apple: everything has a purpose, it&apos;s very clean, and well considered. In the box, you get the keyboard, a USB-C to USB-C cable, and the back panel. I like the inclusion of the back panel for most situations. While I do like this for when I&apos;m carrying it around in a bag, I found that it didn&apos;t always fit as well as I would have liked; there might be an improvement in the tolerancing of the part that could help. I also found that a few times, I would slide the Brydge towards me on a table, and the back panel would catch on the bottom edge and want to come off. When you use it in tablet mode – the mode where you can write on it with the pencil – it does prevent it from folding fully flat; you&apos;ll have to set it off to the side to use it in that way. There&apos;s just no room for the back panel in that device sandwich. It just feels odd to throw that to the side when you want to use it in this way.</p>

<p>The keyboard itself is a Bluetooth keyboard, and utilizes a USB-C cable to charge. You can even charge the keyboard from your iPad Pro if you&apos;re running out of power. Out of the box, the keyboard had about 78% power, which was great to get me started. It took about 5 days for the battery to run down to where I wanted to charge it again, likely due to the backlit keys. I have found that if you&apos;re doing a lot of typing with the keyboard lit, you&apos;re going to drain it a lot faster.</p>
<p>Having the battery in the keyboard means it was going to be heavy compared to the SKF, which brings me to the first thing I immediately noticed about the Brydge Pro keyboard: this thing is <em>heavy</em>. Not just a little, but a lot. At 700 grams for the keyboard and the protective cover, it more than doubles the weight of the iPad Pro<sup id=""fnref-1622-weight""><a href=""#fn-1622-weight"" class=""jetpack-footnote"">2</a></sup> carry in my bag; compare that to the SKF, which clocks in at just 302 grams, and it&apos;s clear to see that you need to be very comfortable with the extra weight if you&apos;re going to carry this around. It may not seem like a lot, but it&apos;s significant. The extra weight is great for when you&apos;re using it in your lap, however, like when you&apos;re on a couch or as I did in a car while on a road trip; the SKF tends to be more top-heavy,<sup id=""fnref-1622-heavy""><a href=""#fn-1622-heavy"" class=""jetpack-footnote"">3</a></sup> and doesn&apos;t feel as stable in those instances whereas the Brydge felt solid.</p>
<p>The next thing I noticed: the keyboard is a bit narrower than the SKF. Being that this is the 11&quot; model, that width can take some getting used to. But I was able to adapt over the first several days. The placement of the Siri key is also a bit difficult with the layout, as my finger often presses is when I&apos;m attempting to use the control key. Again, this layout just takes some getting use to and is not insurmountable; I&apos;m even trying to utilize Siri more now with this key, using the Type to Siri accessibility feature, and the availability of such a key is welcome. Having the media keys above the row is great. I really wish that Apple would figure out how to make this happen. I&apos;ve suggested a couple of different ways before, but I doubt they&apos;d ever consider it.<sup id=""fnref-1622-idea""><a href=""#fn-1622-idea"" class=""jetpack-footnote"">4</a></sup></p>
<p>My review unit did have a couple of issues: I noticed that the lettering on the keys weren&apos;t straight. I notice these sorts of things all the time as part of my day job, so it was immediately apparent to me. It&apos;s not a deal breaker by any means, and my hope is that it is because this is an early review unit. The main issue that I did have with the keyboard has been the missed keystrokes. It&apos;s not all the time, but when it does happen, it takes me out of my writing focus. I reached out to the team at Brydge to let them know, and not only did they quickly respond acknowledging my concern while assuring me that this is not normal and they wanted to inspect the unit to see what was going on, but they also shipped me a new one the day after. Issues can happen in products from time to time, and even though this appears to be an isolated incident, the quick customer service experience and the fact that Brydge stand by their products is fantastic. The second unit I used did not have this issue, and most of my missed keystrokes were due to the more narrow keyboard or my lack of force to activate the key travel.</p>
<p>Overall, I really like the Brydge Pro keyboard. The keys feel very good, the infinite angles and better lap capability are very versatile, and it really does make this combination of Brydge keyboard and iPad Pro feel like a traditional laptop. But I also couldn&apos;t help but notice that this might not be the best keyboard for me for the way I do work. In my day job, I&apos;m often moving between typing and notetaking with the Apple Pencil, and the Brydge is more cumbersome for that particular way of working. I can lay it fully flat, but that doesn&apos;t work as well sitting on my lap.</p>
<p>At the end of my time with the review unit, I came away mixed: it&apos;s not as flexible for my style of working, but it&apos;s a really fantastic option for the iPad Pro. I&apos;m likely keeping my iPad Pro for a few more years, so having this option in addition to the Smart Keyboard Folio and the Smart Folio (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H88J5GS/?tag=nahumck-20"">knockoff</a>) is the trifecta, and something I&apos;m excited to add to my kit portfolio. I might, however, wait a bit before I buy this: with iPadOS 13 and the addition of an accessibility feature which provides cursor support, I can&apos;t help but think that Brydge might be working on a trackpad edition, similar to the version they have for the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/B077GJ92LX/?tag=nahumck-20"">Surface Pro</a>. If this existed, I wouldn&apos;t have to carry an extra piece of kit in my bag. If they added that feature, it would push me over the edge for sure. But if you&apos;re in the market for a laptop-like keyboard, I cannot recommend this one enough.</p>

I actually bought the Smart Folio (SF) before this, but immediately returned it after 30 min because I realized that my use cases needed the SKF.&#160;<a href=""#fnref-1622-first"">&#8617;</a>
</li>
<li id=""fn-1622-weight"">
the iPad Pro weighs 470g, for reference&#160;<a href=""#fnref-1622-weight"">&#8617;</a>

<li id=""fn-1622-heavy"">
There&apos;s that word again, heavy.&#160;<a href=""#fnref-1622-heavy"">&#8617;</a>
</li>
<li id=""fn-1622-idea"">
My idea: turn the &quot;globe&quot; key in the bottom left of the keyboard with a &quot;FN&quot; key. Add the media functions to the number keys in the same way. This would also allow for the addition of a hard-key Siri button if you press and held the combination for a home button. Again, this is <em>a</em> way to solve it, and certainly not the way I envision Apple would do it. But I really wouldn&apos;t mind it being there.&#160;<a href=""#fnref-1622-idea"">&#8617;</a>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I&apos;m writing this, I&apos;m taking a much-needed 3 days of &quot;staycation&quot;. I&apos;ve often loathed this word, but as things have become more and more busy for me at work along with everything that I&apos;ve endured with my personal life, I need it now more than ever.</p>
<p>I have a ton of things to catch up on while I&apos;m off: some appointments, my house, hopefully a movie, and some much needed writing time as well. But this also means doing something that I&apos;m learning to live with: <strong><em>letting go</em></strong>. I&apos;m in a weird space with work: I&apos;m acting like a boss, but I&apos;m not quite official in the title.<sup id=""fnref-1615-promotion""><a href=""#fn-1615-promotion"" class=""jetpack-footnote"">1</a></sup> It&apos;s a trial run. And for the most part, I feel like I&apos;ve been doing a great job in handling it. When it comes to taking some time for me and letting that stuff be handled by others, I&apos;ve noticed that it&apos;s difficult for me.</p>
<p>I haven&apos;t officially managed others before, but I&apos;m getting the opportunity to manage my peers and others through my role. It&apos;s been a unique experience to visibly see the transition from someone who &apos;does&apos; to someone who &apos;manages&apos;. And being honest: that transition is much harder than I thought it would be. It&apos;s a learning curve of ones self to let it go and get done, instead of doing.</p>
<p>Over the years, I&apos;ve set some lofty goals and personal standards for myself. These aren&apos;t always shared in the same way by the people I work with. There are some ways I conduct myself that others might not.<sup id=""fnref-1615-better""><a href=""#fn-1615-better"" class=""jetpack-footnote"">2</a></sup> And it&apos;s hard to sometimes rely on others to complete assignments to your own personal standards. Hopefully I&apos;ve laid out expectations and imparted what little wisdom I can to empower my supporting team to get everything completed while I&apos;m away.</p>
<p>But there are times that you still have to be a &apos;doer&apos;. You <em>do</em> have to let go, and trust that it&apos;s going to get done. The work will still be there when I get back. The building will still be around. The job will still need to be done. But I&apos;m hoping that I can entrust some of my work to others and have them pick up the torch while I&apos;m taking some time for me. I&apos;m hopeful that come Monday, I&apos;ll be able to realize that this is ok and that I don&apos;t have as much to worry about as I think I do.</p>
<div class=""footnotes"">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id=""fn-1615-promotion"">
I really do hope that a promotion is coming. Not counting on it, but it would be a nice cherry on the top of all this stress.&#160;<a href=""#fnref-1615-promotion"">&#8617;</a>
</li>
<li id=""fn-1615-better"">
Yes, of course. There are people who are better than me. Not saying I&apos;m the best, far from it. Not the point here.&#160;<a href=""#fnref-1615-better"">&#8617;</a>

<p>I got into podcasting late. I&apos;ve been listening for years, but I never started my own. But by the time that <a href=""https://nahumck.me/fundamentally-broken/"">Seth and I did</a>, there was an emerging idea started by Jason Snell: <a href=""https://sixcolors.com/post/2016/12/recording-a-podcast-locally-on-ios-without-a-mac/"">recording</a> and <a href=""https://sixcolors.com/post/2015/11/editing-podcasts-on-ios-with-ferrite/"">editing</a> podcasts iOS-only. As someone who rarely ever touches a Mac for their day-to-day work, this idea has continued to gnaw at my brain. I tried my hand a couple of times at doing something differently with it, but it never panned out the way I wanted.</p>
<p>In an effort to head down this road, I ended up switching microphones last year: I had the clutch <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N1YPXW2/?tag=nahumck-20"">Blue Yeti</a> microphone, but decided on the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004QJOZS4/?tag=nahumck-20"">Audio-Technica ATR2100-USB</a> instead. Not only was it better for the environment in which I record, but it also afforded me the possibility to record using both the USB and XLR connections, pushing me closer to the goal of iOS-only.</p>
<p>A month or so ago, I was recording the show via the late-2012 Mac mini I have. I ended up having an issue while recording, and I lost my audio in several spots. Given that this is one of two jobs that I ever ask it to do, I was understandably upset and put off by recording in the same way going forward. The idea of going iOS-only came back to the forefront of my mind. I again turned to <a href=""https://sixcolors.com/post/2019/02/a-week-of-podcasting-with-only-an-ipad-pro/"">Jason&apos;s setup</a>, only to realize that this was going to cost me several hundred dollars to create. I don&apos;t have that lying around, and I wanted to find something that would work for me.</p>
<p>I can already record iOS-only: I can use my iPhone with AirPods to make the call and use my iPad Pro to record the local audio. This is how I recorded my end when I guested on <a href=""https://www.relay.fm/automators/23"">Episode 23 of the Automators podcast</a>. I enjoyed doing this, but I also don&apos;t have a great way of having the good audio from my mic broadcast to the other hosts. I like the idea of using the iOS devices I have to record: I&apos;m always going to have them with me, so it just makes more sense to use them for the complete audio setup. I can use either device to record or make the call, I just need a way to get the sound of the mic to both of them. So that&apos;s where my search started. I had most of what I needed, I just needed an XLR interface of some type. Rather than search &apos;USB XLR interface&apos; like I had done multiple times before, I ended up just searching for &apos;XLR interface&apos;.</p>
<p>That&apos;s when I ended up finding something new and unique: the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LS9JI22/?tag=nahumck-20"">Røde i-XLR</a>. This device was made for reporters, plugging into an XLR microphone and allowing mobile recording of interviews; when I saw it, I thought it might work perfectly for podcasting as well. Rather than take my XLR connection through an <a href=""https://www.sounddevices.com/product/usbpre-2/"">expensive USB interface</a> into an <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DPOXS8I/?tag=nahumck-20"">XLR recorder</a> of some type or another adaptor to my iPhone, this allows me to use my XLR connection and plug it directly into the iPhone without all the extra cables and steps. There&apos;s even an app – the <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/r%C3%B8de-reporter/id1066635435?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ"">Røde Recorder</a> – which was specifically made for this microphone. The idea was intriguing, so I decided to purchase it and test it out.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s how my setup is all connected, using my iPad Pro 2018 and my iPhone Xs.<sup id=""fnref-1590-links""><a href=""#fn-1590-links"" class=""jetpack-footnote"">1</a></sup> First, I start with the power: I recommend using this Anker <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0721DV7YX/?tag=nahumck-20"">wall-charger</a>, which provides a Power Delivery USB-C port along with a USB-A quick charge. I use it all the time for travel, and it&apos;s perfect for what I need. I use a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LNA0XCU/?tag=nahumck-20"">USB-C to USB-C</a> to power the iPad. Next, I connect the USB microphone cable to the iPad Pro using the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K6YFW7X/?tag=nahumck-20"">Satechi hub</a>;<sup id=""fnref-1590-hub""><a href=""#fn-1590-hub"" class=""jetpack-footnote"">2</a></sup> this also allows me to use the HDMI for an external monitor and the USB-C port to power everything. Then, I connect the Røde iXLR to the end of the cable which comes with the microphone, and plug that into my iPhone directly. Finally, I connect the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003LPTAYI/?tag=nahumck-20"">over-the-ear headphones</a> to the the Røde iXLR and do a test recording to dial in the sound level for the environment. When I have that part set and I&apos;m happy with the audio, I&apos;ll connect the monitors directly to the back of the microphone so I can use them for the audio call; I can monitor the sound visually using Røde Reporter or <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ferrite-recording-studio/id1018780185?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ"">Ferrite</a>. I prefer using Ferrite due to the smaller file sizes and better recording controls for volume as well as the ability to bookmark the audio when topic change and/or I cough; it helps me in the edit later. However, I have noticed that using the configuration menu in Røde Reporter allows me to use a -20 dB pad for the mic, resulting in quieter background noise and an overall better sound.</p>
<p>I did run into one small technical issue when getting this all set up: when the i-XLR is connected to the iPhone, the cellular radio creates an interference with the audio. To avoid this in the audio track, I have to turn on airplane mode,<sup id=""fnref-1590-Seth""><a href=""#fn-1590-Seth"" class=""jetpack-footnote"">3</a></sup> then turn on the WiFi and then record. It&apos;s a simple issue, and one that I&apos;m not too concerned about: I can still get calls or messages if something is urgent. I also don&apos;t want to be disturbed when I&apos;m recording so that I can give the other person (or people) my fullest attention possible, so it&apos;s a non-issue for me.<sup id=""fnref-1590-device""><a href=""#fn-1590-device"" class=""jetpack-footnote"">4</a></sup></p>

<p>From here on out, I&apos;m going to be recording iOS-only using this setup: my iPhone will record my local audio, and my iPad Pro will handle the call. The only bit that I don&apos;t have is the recording of the call itself, which isn&apos;t a big deal to me as long as the people I&apos;m recording with know what they are doing. This setup allows me to use my iOS devices which have shown to be more dependable than my Mac mini. I find my new setup option to be better for the actual running of the show: I can have my iPad Pro in split screen to handle show notes in <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-capture-act/id1236254471?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ"">Drafts</a>, Safari to do any real-time look-up, and the call in slide over on Skype; if I&apos;m using FaceTime, I can simply just jump back to the call if I want by tapping the green indicator in the upper left of the screen.</p>
<p>This setup works surprisingly well. The audio quality is completely fine for anyone who&apos;s not a die-hard purist with bottomless pockets. I&apos;ve been testing a lot with it and can&apos;t notice a difference in what I&apos;ve been producing in the past. I&apos;m trying to do this for as little as possible. For someone who has an iPad and an iPhone, you can have a complete setup – for both home and travel – for around $400 all-in, including all of the chargers, cables, usb hub, interface, and microphone.<sup id=""fnref-1590-total""><a href=""#fn-1590-total"" class=""jetpack-footnote"">7</a></sup> It&apos;s even less if you already have chargers or a USB hub. You can even expand the setup over time, making it the most versatile setup out there.</p>
<p>I think this is the best part of the mobile setup I&apos;ve created: I don&apos;t need to have more wires and boxes costing me hundreds of dollars more. I will always have my iPhone and iPad with me, so this just makes more sense. It also helps make my setup portable, making my <a href=""https://nahumck.me/perfectly-mobile/"">mobile setup</a> that much better. So while I impatiently wait for WWDC to bring changes to the way I can podcast using only my iPad, I have found the best possible work-around for my uses. I&apos;ll share how I edit on iOS in my next post.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the course of the last year, I had transitioned away from GoodTask to Things, then Todoist, then back to Things. I might have even missed a quick affair with OmniFocus as well. But I digress.</p>
<p>GoodTask has been my long-time favorite Reminders client. From the <a href=""https://nahumck.me/goodtask-3-an-unexpected-surprise/"">surprise</a> the first time I started really using it to now, it has made improvement after improvement in both functionality and appearance settings (love me those themes) on all platforms – iOS, macOS, and the Apple Watch. I was inclined to go back to GoodTask when the Apple Watch app was updated, so I moved everything over there in the beta. I had mentioned to the developer that there were a couple features which I was missing from Things, but I was very happy with the improvements to the apps. Those suggestions plus others were carefully considered, because they are now in the version 4.5 update of the app.</p>
<h1>Tag Sorting</h1>
<p>GoodTask 4.5 brings with it the ability to sort a List or Smart List based on tags. Tags are a clever implementation in GoodTask, which puts a <code>#tag</code> into the note of a reminder. GoodTask can parse this as a tag, and allow you to use that information within the note as a tag, much like the other information the developer uses to implement sub tasks. You can use all of your tags or specific tags per list, which is great for customizing how you view your different lists.</p>
<p>With the new tag options, I&#8217;m able to now recreate some of the features that Things provided which gives me a better view of my tasks in different views. It all stems from the ability to sort lists and smart lists using Tags first, then due dates, etc.</p>
<p>I absolutely love the headings feature of Things. When I have a specific project, having the breakout of different subsections is better for my brain. And with the tag sorting, I can re-create this now in GoodTask. For example, I can take all of the tasks in my Nerd Life<sup id=""fnref-1579-affectionate""><a href=""#fn-1579-affectionate"" class=""jetpack-footnote"">1</a></sup>, apply the tags, and have the list sorted on them. While it may not be quite as pretty as the Things implementation, the capability in GoodTask allows me to break it down to key areas just the same.</p>

<p>Another key feature of Things that I adore is the Today view. Having your tasks along with the calendar is a fantastic singular view of what is ahead of me. Having a separate &#8216;today&#8217; and &#8216;evening&#8217; section has been critical for me to quickly view and clarify what needs to be done. Now with the tag sorting, I can recreate this view in GoodTask. I created a Smart List which includes my calendar, tasks scheduled for today, and any overdue tasks. This list is sorted by Tag then Due Date, and I also have my calendar events sorted on top, listed under the order section. I created a quick action to apply a <code>#Today</code> and <code>#Evening</code> tag as a toggle, so that I can quickly tag tasks which show up in the view. Again, this might not be as visually appealing as the Things view, but it provides me what I need while keeping the native Reminders service integration.</p>

<h3>Completing Tasks</h3>
<p>For a while now, I&#8217;ve been wanting to see more <a href=""https://nahumck.me/rethinking-reminders/"">improvements to Reminders</a>, but lately I&#8217;ve been wanting improved support within Shortcuts. When I think of what I want Shortcuts to ultimately be, I can&#8217;t help but want certain features added: for Reminders, having the ability to check off a task would be beneficial for certain shortcuts. So while we wait Shortcuts.app to catch up, GoodTask has added a Siri Shortcut to complete a task (and do so in the background). You&#8217;ll need to go to Settings → Siri Shortcuts → Add Complete Task to get the Siri Shortcut and/or add it to Shortcuts.app.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m getting old, so I take vitamins. I use a reminder to trigger this, so I don&#8217;t forget. I took this one step further and created a shortcut to run on my iPhone which logs the vitamin intake – including all the breakdown of the various types of vitamins – into the Health app, as well as mark it in Streaks as complete to help me keep track of when I&#8217;ve taken it.

<p>I use the native Reminders notifications due to the fact that they remain on the lock screen, but actions like the one outlined above have me rethinking that approach. GoodTask allows users to run a URL from the notification, which means I could run the shortcut straight from the notification and complete it all in one go. I&#8217;ll likely look to play around with this as time goes on.<sup id=""fnref-1579-breath""><a href=""#fn-1579-breath"" class=""jetpack-footnote"">3</a></sup></p>
<p>The full list of improvements can be <a href=""https://forum.goodtaskapp.com/t/goodtask-4-5-update/157/3"">found on the forums</a>. Having been away for a while, I can see that there is a lot more to offer now with GoodTask than ever before. The developer is listening to suggestions, is adding features at a manageable pace, and I can really appreciate the level of continued development for the app.</p>

![Slimmed Background App Location Use Banner](https://i.snap.as/lgUN78W.jpeg)

## Native Apps
- [ ] The **App Store**... where the *fuck* are my goddamned updates!!!
- [ ] I’ve been Uber/Lyft driving recently which involves serving live location data to *at least* three individual apps between rides. (When “online” for both services,
- [ ] **Are you kidding me.** 
IOS supports the AVRCP 1.6 standard, which includes album art when connected to a supported car kit or speaker.
Definitely not an unreasonable priority at all.
- [ ] The ability to crop and rotate video comes *years* too late for me... I was made a casualty long ago...
> Nearly everything you can do with a photo you can now do with a video. Adjustments, filters, and crop support video editing, so you can rotate, increase exposure, or even apply filters to your videos. Video editing supports all video formats captured on iPhone, including video in 4K at 60 fps and slo-mo in 1080p at 240fps. 
- [ ] Apple’s native Notes app appears completely unchanged to me??? As in... it’s still immediately unusable because of its tacky-ass leather stucco-ish background texture.

### Apple Maps
- [ ] **MAPS... HOLY SHIT**

![iOS 13 Control Panel Bluetooth Options](https://i.snap.as/Zn36HXu.jpeg)

### Command Center
- [ ] Though it still drives me absolutely fucking bonkers that the team won’t just use 3D touch to allow users to ~fully~ disable bluetooth and/or wifi from the **Command Center** (or just utilize it more in general,)  the new device/connection selection and shortcut to each protocol’s respective menu in Settings *are* positive steps in a sensible direction. I’m starting to suspect that Apple must surely have some sort of good practice standard which such a feature would violate because even [my own quick-disable shortcut](https://shortcutsgallery.com/shortcuts/turn-off-bluetooth-wifi/) has inexplicably ceased functioning in the past 6 months. :(

[image:D79067AB-E13E-4CC4-9C84-83452A305849-2324-000000A8F61C9F1D/sharesheetdark.png]

### Notes
Though I was just defending skeuomorphism, I have somehow managed to hate everything about the way iOS’ native Notes app has looked since the very beginning.

### Safari
I’m sad to say, is still far from the most effective browser available on iOS - I decided to swap it back in to slot #1 on my doc, replacing [Firefox](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/firefox-private-safe-browser/id989804926) for the duration of this experience. 
In keeping with that comparison: [Firefox 12 for iOS](https://www.engadget.com/2018/06/12/firefox-12-ios-file-downloads-easier-syncing/) introduced a Downloads manager & folder, “unified link management,” and iCloud sync in February of last year, which left the native Safari at perhaps its lowest point of regard on iPhone. For most of us UX obsessives, it has only been launched in the time since by hyperlinks from the few good apps remaining which still do not offer a default preference to Chrome and/or Firefox. One would imagine, then, that the iOS Safari team has been under substantial internal pressure to deliver a miraculous rework/featureset bent on conquering the hearts of app critics and powerusers once again. Unfortunately, the version I’ve been subjecting myself to  in iOS 13 Beta smells an awful lot like defeatism.

- [ ] Tab switching is still the smoothest-animated, but remains by far the slowest and most crashy of all the mainstream mobile browsers.

- [ ] Unfortunately, it’s quite pitiful when Apple *invents* features months/years after the *alternative* crowd mastered them *on the fringe* with zero disadvantages. There *are* some genuinely-clever additions like **saving open tabs as bookmarks**, and informed folks like *[Gadget Hacks](https://ios.gadgethacks.com/news/20-features-ios-13s-safari-you-wont-want-miss-0198425/)* who’ve described it as “formidable,” yet many of their citations invoke token Apple jokes. *Thank you so much, your majesties, for giving us this new gift of your genius... The Start Page*.

- [ ] The one ever-improving advantage of using native Safari which I think we can all agree on aligns with Apple’s new - and actually quite admirable - **privacy and security-founded brand identity**. (

- [ ] > A new downloads folder gives you a central place to access your web downloads and attachments from Safari and Mail.

### Siri
- [ ] Siri is my favorite voice assistant because she’s by far the biggest idiot of the bunch, yet I’ve found her to *actually* add real functionality to my experience.

## Keyboard Shortcuts 
- [ ] The new “Quickpath” swiping keyboard makes zero sense as a feature add at this point, but okay Craig.
- [ ] Fucking **VALIDATED** by the attention to keyboard shortcuts (most of the big-deal PadOS’ new shortcuts seem to have been tossed in the iPhone too. God Bless.) Very nice of Craig Apple... I am the only iPhone user in history who has (and continues to) ever made use of this feature more than once. (I didn’t have a laptop in Community College so I just fooled around in Evernote, hunched over my little iPhone 4S to reach the fucking thing.)
*Specifically* though... I can’t find any direct mention of it in Apple’s current preview documentation, but Command-Space shows/hides **Spotlight**, which is the only way to switch between apps without the touchscreen (I can’t seem to find a definite answer on whether or not Command-Tab ever functionally switch applications on iPhone, but I think I would remember it.) This function has always been just clunky enough to interrupt a good workflow.
For instance, let’s say I needed to switch from this very document in Bear to YouTube in order to grab a hyperlink to a [quick demo capture](https://youtu.be/Yt5lPqn2i6M). Here’s what my keystrokes would look like:
`Command Space y o u tab enter`

- [ ]  The various performance updates might seem like a bonus to some, but those of us who’ve been paying attention (out of need or curiosity) to the *absolutely absurd* size of regular app updates to date find the rework of software packages in iOS 13  (claimed 50% smaller App Store packages and 60% smaller updates) to be nothing more than a monstrously-late address to conclude *years* of gross negligence. (Remember we’re talking about the world’s richest company, here... There is no excuse for anything but perfection.)

![Apple Bets on Rich Text](https://i.snap.as/COuYE0d.jpeg)
- [ ] Amazing. Revolutionary. Unfortunately, I am not quite dilligent enough to count how many times Rich Text was mentioned in the ~2.5 hour [WWDC 2019 keynote](https://youtu.be/UThGcWBIMpU) 

- [ ] [iOS 13: You can soon install, manage and download custom fonts for your iPhone](https://www.cnet.com/news/ios-13-ipados-iphone-install-download-manage-custom-fonts-from-app-store-settings/) | *CNET* 

## General UI
- [ ] Admittedly, it did not occur to me just how stale iOS’ audio/ringer volume indicator had become until I first hit a hardware button while running 13 and marveled at the newfound consideration of use exhibited by Apple’s placement of the new element where it belonged 12 years ago. 

> Apple is making it a lot easier to delete apps in iOS 13. Now, whenever you see a pending app update on the App Store (or have already downloaded and installed one), swipe left on the app. You’ll see the familiar red “Delete” button, which you can tap to remove the app from your iPhone or iPad.
-*[Lifehacker](https://lifehacker.com/the-best-ios-13-tricks-you-havent-tried-yet-1835838149)*

- [ ] Another reminder from me about 3D Touch for the hell of it, really: **it’s good.** It’s probably not worth depleting you of patience *entirely* and/or *existentially*, but you’re missing out on perhaps the most satisfying way to Touch Your Phone, if nothing else. I usually suggest practicing force-touching apps directly on the homescreen to prompt the quick function/share menu without fear of inordinate consequences

- [ ] I could be losing my mind, but I’m almost positive an twisting animation has been added when switching apps/returning to the homescreen.

After nearly a year of relative sobriety from my old, once-severe addiction to Web Site hunting, it occurred to me just yesterday that some explicit wandering as I once did for days at a time - through the clever, innovative, and uniquely tasteful projects through which an astonishingly-original few give their whole thinking (and often physical) selves in obscurity despite how little financial (and often professional) incentive is maintained by those who unknowingly need it the most - might be the best feasible remedy to my current, most perplexing state of faithlessness and bafflement toward the ambitions of trades and cultures I feel I once so thoroughly understood.

Every year since the first generation iPhone’s announcement in 2007, I have made it a tradition to watch the entirety of the World Wide Developer Conference’s opening keynote regardless of how disappointed I’ve expected to be since iOS 7 - the [post-Steve, post-skeuomorphic overhaul](https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/18/4741724/ios-7-review) used to justify the silent deletion of a few favorite features which I received as a cruel, deeply personal betrayal because my relationship with iPhone and iOS is both deeply personal and pretentiously complex. I have done my best to address this truth with brevity in preface to [everything I've written about iOS so far](https://extratone.com/tag:ios) in hopes that I can contribute substantially to related discourse from a unique perspective. (At this point, it would probably be more reasonable if I just created a static disclaimer/explainer document, but standardization remains the *last possible thing* technology writing needs more of.) If you've arrived seeking a more contemporarily-arranged article about iOS 13, you might consider [my unedited notes for this piece](http://bit.ly/13beta) to be a sort of haphazard bibliography.

## As we bid farewell to the Miata’s third-generation, sizing up its top trim summarizes its legacy.
I recently had the chance to drive the facelifted 2013 Mazda MX-5. This is the first time the looks of the perky roadster have changed since the front-mounted smile became an all-out grin of insanity in 2008. They have once again dulled it to what I would call a smirk. The new front end blends with the rest of car more than it has in the past. It seems to have grown a bit more serious. In fact, with black 17-inch alloys on a glossy black (creatively called ""Brilliant Black,"") this example is the most aggressive-looking of any Miata I have seen.

That's not to say it's aggressive in the slightest, even in such a scheme. This car is in the “Club” trim replacing the previous “Touring” designation as the top-of-the-line option. This selection adds ridiculous three-leaf clover side badges, red stitching on the seats, red stripes on the dash and sides, along with a price tag very near 30,000 USD.

![2013 Mazda MX-5 - Badging](https://i.snap.as/edJ18j9.jpeg)

So I present you with my first problem with this particular car....it's a contradiction. The MX-5 was never intended to look serious. That grin was there to convey the primary attribute aspired to by its creators; joy. It's designed to be joyful in driving and the exterior of previous generations did a good job of communicating what the car is all about. Unfortunately, it seems they have decided that it's time for the roadster to grow up. Frankly, that's not going to work.

Now, to the drive.

For this year, the car has been lightened, the braking response quickened, as well as the throttle response in manual-equipped cars. Unfortunately, I was only able to drive the 6-speed automatic with optional pattle-shifters. Given that this is my first drive in an NC (third generation) MX-5, I can only compare it to my own NB.

![2013 Mazda MX-5 - Trunk](https://i.snap.as/AwmhWqh.jpeg)

Immediately, my passenger and chaperon starts the process of opening the optional retractable hard top. Open air is this car's natural environment, and it appears that somebody got busy making sure its occupants never notice. Wind buffeting has been drastically reduced. We were able to maintain conversation beyond 70mph without necessitating shouting thanks to a much taller wind brake behind our seats. Unfortunately, I couldn't really hear much of anything from the 158-hp 2.0L 4 up front, even with liberal amounts of right foot burying. It would seem the optional dual exhaust outlets are rather pointless then.

![2013 Mazda MX-5 - Engine](https://i.snap.as/jF3z0Qc.jpeg)

Getting in the car, I had expected the experience to be ruined by the 6-speed auto. Buying a Miata with an automatic is sort of like going on a scenic vacation without a camera. It doesn't necessarily ruin the immediate experience but you'll always have some regret regarding the subject in the future. The pattles add some of the fun back in, but I prefer the Golf GTI's arrangement of right side-shift up, left side-shift down, while the MX-5 has both functions on either side of the wheel.

It took some deliberate self-coaching to get used to, but it won't effect your daily driving experience. Another plus; when in manual shift mode, it is truly manual, meaning the transmission will allow you to exceed the redline. It may sound trivial, but being nannied when you're first told that you're in control can be a major annoyance. (Looking at you, Kia Forte.) It's disappointing that Mazda chose only to up throttle response in manual-equipped cars. This one most certainly needed it.

The original Miata was built on a philosophy of communication between driver and machine, summarized in the Japanese phrase “Jinba Ittai,” meaning “rider and horse are one.” Being an MX-5 owner, this philosophy is very important to me, thus my expectations for the steering were very high. It was very disappointing, then, to discover that it has been very nearly ruined.

![](Last%20Year%20of%20the%20NC%202013%20Mazda%20MX-5%20Club%20Review/IMG_9568.JPG)
![2013 Mazda MX-5 - Driver’s Side](https://i.snap.as/dLg41pi.jpeg)

The leather-wrapped steering wheel was comfortable, yes, but not very generous in revealing the road. In corners it felt jumpy, imprecise, and unsure of itself. The same lack of self-confidence was noticeable in a straight line as well, along with a nervous fidget. Keep in mind, I am comparing this to roadsters of the past, not to other automobiles currently on the market. It would take a global nuclear war to make the MX-5 less fun to drive than a Toyota Camry.

Though it has lost communication and soul, the Miata has gained a more comfortable suspension and oodles of storage space. The trunk is massive for a roadster of this size, and the example I drove was equipped with an optional storage compartment extending behind the seats, especially handy for CDs, candy, and the like. The center console contains two reasonably-sized cupholders obscured by a sliding door that will inevitably lead to annoyance in single-drink occasions. Mr. Cunningham also pointed out to me that the track on which the door slides appears vulnerable to crumbs. Only time will tell, I suppose.

![](Last%20Year%20of%20the%20NC%202013%20Mazda%20MX-5%20Club%20Review/IMG_9571.JPG)
![2013 Mazda MX-5 - Center Console](https://i.snap.as/fTXsEEn.jpeg)

In general, being inside the car is a much more comfortable experience, albeit a boring one. It seems to me that the MX-5 has “grown up,” forgoing fun for comfort and practicality. And is that not exactly the opposite of the direction it should be moving? It was never meant to be an aggressive-looking performance car, and it will never do well as one. It will never be luxurious enough to be a true touring car, either.

Its soul has made it the top-selling roadster of all time, and I'm afraid it's losing it, bit by bit. To be honest, if you're attracted by the values on which the original Miata was built, I would recommend a Subaru BRZ/Toyota GT 86/Scion FR-S. The recommendation does not come lightly or easily.

Until Mazda gets wise about what it's doing to the beloved little car, I'm afraid it's headed down a path that will mean losing a grip on the niche it's held for so long, and that's quite saddening.

If you've paid any attention to my sparse autowriting since 2013, you might've noticed that I've found myself chronicling my journey to kill every last brand bias-born ignorant assumption within my perspective for clarity's sake. It required Juke NISMO and Xterra wheeltime for me to understand the strengths of my favorite adolescent target, Nissan, and just one night out with the CrossCabriolet to see its shortcomings. Eight years in proximity to CR-V ownership in tandem with an active academic effort to look at South Korea's then-upcoming place in the industry empirically let down the mystical aura in which Honda once dwelled for me throughout my later childhood. Driving the EcoBoost Mustang in Portland last year was a brutally epiphanous smack in the face as I began to realize just how confused this country's automotive culture is when it comes to our historic brands' identities and how they should be represented in the present. How can marques like ""Mustang"" and ""Jeep"" possibly mean anything after both the engineering and consumer expectations have changed so drastically? For all the marketing, PR, and editorial talent employed by the remaining car giants, one wonders how many live moment to excruciating moment in full-body mortal terror.
I haven't written a car review in years, but I thought I should take the opportunity to confront what I hope to be my last toxic brand bias. Believe it or not, I once had an awfully agricultural driving experience with a restored civilian Willy's from the early 1950s, which couldn't have contrasted more against the past three weeks I've spent with the 2019 Jeep Compass, which has - perhaps above all else - an absolutely horrendous name. It's a cheap joke, but I can't imagine it ever falling flat: that cold, round, steel, entirely unassisted steering wheel has been replaced with a heated leather unit connected to an electromechanical rack that leaves embarrassingly little required effort from its operator. I can't be bothered with a confirmation, but I suspect the lot of it was sourced from Fiat, which would make any old Jeep customer from the Grand Cherokee's golden era fall immediately ill - if you could actually manage to convince them you weren't joking, that is. This model year apparently starts at $21,095, but my ""Limited""-specced example would manage to set you back a mid-boggling $33,045 with its decently-composed CarPlay-equipped infotainment system, heated leather seats, steering wheel, and door mirrors, keyless entry, and a few more checked checkmarks which aren't particularly relevant or interesting. Considering, I must (perhaps unfairly) insert some conclusive commentary already: this vehicle is fucking overpriced. Pre-research, I was briefly impressed by the rumor that my car was priced almost $8,000 less, which would almost make it a bargain, but - God be with them - there really are Americans out there spending more than $30,000 on these every day.
To be honest, I'm growing very tired of driving Fiat-Chrysler products that come from the factory completely let down by their drivetrains. It's been over five years since new automatic-equipped Dodge Darts so thoroughly disappointed even the least-discerning owners with its driving behavior thanks to the transmission's horrendously-fudged mapping. The Compass' 9-speed ZF automatic looks great on paper - for some thirty years, the Friedrichshafen name has the badge of the industry's most dynamically capable available pairings with any given luxury power plant - but the reality of Jeep's execution is despicably discouraging. No, it's not as entirely-comprising as the Dart's, but it's certainly bad enough to warrant recommending checking out the ""4x4 Manual"" trim if you insist on Compass ownership, which should at least enable more hands-on drivers to make the best of the model's inescapably inadequate 180 horsepower 2.4 Liter four. It's not hopeless, by any means, but its ~3,500 lb. burden requires a significant amount of work in normal driving from whoever is making gearchange decisions - whether it ultimately be a human being or daftly-programmed computer. Staying with traffic on a typical United States highway will require them often - attacking fairly moderate inclines in such a setting at a cruise controlled 76mph had my example downshifting three whole gears to tackle in a manner noticeable enough to breach the unconscious threshold of even the least mechanically-empathetic operator. 
More than most other categories, the Compass' place among the newborn ""Compact Sport Utility"" segment should be examined with thorough critique. When I brought it up with a good friend of mine, he introduced me to the term ""Mall Crawler,"" which I've desperately needed to describe a specific compartment of local car culture for several years now.
Jeep, Nissan, and Subaru have entered into this no man's land of budget-friendly crossovers that straddle the unclaimed dimensionality between subcompact and compact crossovers with the Jeep Compass, Nissan Rogue Sport, and Subaru Crosstrek. Bonus: All three are new to the market this year.
Yes, those who are seriously considering a pick from this segment should consider this MotorTrend comparison of the Compass, Rogue Sport, and Crosstrek to be required reading. I haven't driven either of the other two, though - for what it's worth - my sister and brother-in-law bought the latter in 2017 and have nothing but good things to say, which confirms Christian Seabaugh's first place endorsement of Subaru's entry. To him, the ""Trailhawk""-trimmed Compass ""feels like an old-school body-on-frame SUV,"" which is a considerable compliment, and I'd at least partially concur in the Limited's case. It's important to consider that my Compass was proudly equipped with what Jeep calls ""4WD,"" which is a proclamation I personally hadn't seen branded on any non-pickup automotive products in a long time. (Then again, I'm almost positive I saw such a badge on the back of a fourth-generation CR-V the other day, which seems auspicious, at best.) When I took the opportunity to pilot the confusingly-pseudoplush Compass about a handful of forlorn county gravel roads, it was much more competent than I expected. In fact, I'm not sure I could name a vehicle from my own experience - including a vast assortment of pickups - which was any less perturbed by loose limestone. After manually depressing the ""4wd Lock"" control, it was simply unstickable in the most precarious corner entries my local routes could muster, even when ""fording"" a foot or two-deep crick.

​​ 
​​A decade before I was born, my father farmed soybeans in Georgia with my half-sister and her mother. There, he discovered that poisonous snakes were a regular and legitimate threat, in rural parts - cottonmouths and copperheads in the grass. To protect himself and the family, he bought a revolver - a Ruger .357 Magnum - and kept it on his hip in a leather holster, loaded with six shotshells - a particular type of cartridge in which a solid projectile is replaced with pellets, essentially turning a rifled handgun into a shotgun. (This sort of ammunition is known colloquially as ""snake shot."") According to the stories I remember, his preparation proved its worth on several occasions, but by the time I was eight or nine, he'd lived long enough on the North-Mid-Missouri flatland on which I grew up to recognize its comparative lack of natural dangers, and so, the then-weathered Ruger had long been sequestered to a cabinet in the old house's sun porch.
​​
​​As strange as my childhood was in comparison to my peers - as much common culture from which I was exempted - the complex stigma of the gun was not included. Though little recollection of that time is at all definite, I do remember a sparked curiosity the first time I stumbled upon it, there, and it was my first expression of this attention that prompted Dad to retrieve it, late one afternoon, and lay it - sans-ammunition, dusty & distressed, but still well-oiled - in front of me upon the short wooden table in the living room with sanded edges for my safety. It's cliche, but it really is the weight - the density of milled steel - that defines one's first impressions, holding a real handgun.  Considering the sentiments my father would express as I shifted its weight to and fro by way of the old handgrip's grain and cycled the action with its serrated hammer, he made no particular ceremony of the occasion. It was from behind an oaken half wall, seated at his computer desk, out of sight, that he told me what it all meant. Whether by design or not, I believe it was essential how calmly he explained its function as a weapon - exactly what it could do, and when - where it and its ammunition were kept, and the ideal attitude with which to regard it: respect without fear.
​​
​​To be afraid of it, he explained, could be just as dangerous as handling it recklessly, like a toy, and I'd like to think it was due in large part to his delivery of this advisory that led to the instincts still ingrained in the deepest parts of my psyche to this day. Perhaps it was my Germanic obsession with mechanical relationships that lent toward precocious knowledge and appreciation (ripening incubators of respect) for the precision and physics involved in engineering a firearm, which quickly sated any juvenile, maliciously exploratory curiosities, and formed the essence of my particular motivation to handle weapons: to experience - and later master - their operation. It wouldn't be until early adolescence that I'd have to confront the basal human psychology of the power of the gun, as is notably inevitable in the conversation, but I believe it was the nature and volume of my exposure, in childhood, that would leave me ideally prepared.
​​
​​In reflection, it's obvious that my father didn't care much for weapons. From a devotee's perspective, the Ruger and his well-worn lever-action, .308 Savage 99 - which he kept in his pickup for coyotes and trespassers in the Georgian era - were rather neglected, and virtually irrelevant in day-to-day life. There were a couple of dusty shotguns, somewhere, with which he had allegedly hunted ducks and pheasants from the blind with friends and siblings, but they were far from his first thought upon the sight of either fowl, in the field, and the duck-themed depictions throughout the house - of which there were many - were haplessly reverent paintings and fading quilted patterns instead of stuffed trophies. (There were also at least two painted wooden carvings.)
​​
​​Dad's inability to muster any believable bloodlust helped us understand one another, in this regard. I began just wanting to shoot the gun, apathetic as to any particular target; he preferred nurturing to destruction, and would've rather spent the time tending to his garden.
​​
​​Shortly after my first education with the revolver, he bought me a Daisy Red Ryder BB gun - as decrepit and cliche of an American rite of passage as the Pledge of Allegiance, vacation bible school, and the ancient, exhausting film A Christmas Story (and its local and curricular theatre adaptations,) from which you likely know its brand and cheeky, painfully-suburban accompanying catchphrase: you'll shoot your eye out. They can be had 'for $30 apiece from your nearest Cracker Barrel (undoubtedly the most surreal and horrific American dining experience imaginable for any visiting foreigner unfortunate enough to wander in,) and virtually every single male relative had at least one of the miserable things lying around. Once, while I was visiting family in central Illinois, my same-age second cousin demonstrated for me his intermittent hobby of shooting BBs into the sides of grazing cattle behind his farmhouse, which I found - even minus any tangible ability to empathize with any living thing - to be a pointless and unamusing infliction of suffering. (He insisted that the spherical metallic projectiles couldn't possibly penetrate their hides at the Daisy's rudimentary pneumatic-launched velocities, but they didn't seem to find it very cute.)

​​I, myself possessed a particular disdain for approximations of adult things as a child, and never accomplished much with my Red Ryder save for the inadvertent maiming of an ancient, humongous toad, for which I shall surely suffer some excruciating and grotesque ailment, by karma, at some future date. It did at least fulfill its intended role as training wheels for the traditional mindfulness my father required I demonstrate before he'd let me wander around the bordering forests and half-dozen ponds of the 800-acre farm with a real firearm, and the wait was not long.
​​
​​If memory serves, I was a month from turning eleven years old when Dad acquired for me - through some obscure dealer - a gorgeous, limited-edition black-on-cherry bolt-action Marlin .22 rifle for Christmas - an object which quickly stirred within me an affection unlike any I should hope to experience ever again. I've been unable to forget the smell of its powder discharge mixed with gun oil before passing through my runny nose on that first frigid Winter outing as I cycled my perceptibly unlimited supply of little rimfire cartridges through its seven-round magazine. Though I have yet to live through a quarter-century, my experiences with my .22 happened in a different era, entirely, when 1000-round boxes of Remington brand full metal jacket or hollowpoint ammunition could be found in the sporting goods section of any ole big-box store for fifteen dollars. According to my sparse contact with enthusiasts in the decade since I last held my rifle, a stockpiling frenzy coinciding with the inauguration of Barack Obama has left retailers more or less powerless to keep up with demand, suddenly eliminating a stigma of reassuring excess that had pervaded, unshaken for a hundred years of American recreational shooting.
​​
​​My prepubescent supply, though, was a challenge to diminish, if anything, which quickly metamorphosed nearly every object in my isolated world into a fair-game target. When my father retired to his midday naps, I'd fill the pockets of my Vietnam-era Army jacket with a few handfuls of loose, clinking ammo and my extra magazine before venturing out - regardless of the season - to walk my work boots over tasseling fescue grass, around barbed wire fences, through steel & aluminum gates, under pin oaks, maples, cedars, and foul, parasitic locust trees - over rows of soybeans and between itchy, towering corn stalks with that magnificent, richly-aromatic thing rested on my shoulder, looking for the right squirrel's nest, splintered fence post, or fossilized implement remnant to pump a few rounds in. At first, I was alone, but we'd soon bring home a zealous three-month-old yellow Labrador named Dolly that summer, who's unlimited energy and zest for life propelled her from puppyhood to ninety-pound cruise-missile-of-the-brush status in a single school year, and instilled in her the wholehearted adoration of freedom necessary to become the perfect boyhood companion. For a young man in those early stages of independence-seeking, responsibility-worshiping development, it was a novel paradise - the stuff of fiction.
​​
​​North by any substantial distance from the geological consequences of dearest Big Muddy's path, the meat of Missouri is flat. Fucking flat. In daylight, one's field of vision - one's entire world - is constricted by the limitations of Earth's curvature, which dooms his/her/their horizon to fall away after just three miles, at eye level, confining the maximum possible diameter of my home planet to approximately six miles, in ideal conditions.

Significantly more humble but also somewhere on a ~5 year decline in mental health. 

I'm glad you're experiencing a time of positive transition at least! Cincinnati is so much more beautiful than people give it credit for! Especially if you love riverboats lol.

I use the online/offline sounds to check for this issue regularly. If they play through the speaker, all is well. 

If they do NOT, I've found that calling myself/any number with the phone app and immediately switching the call to speakerphone mode before ending it to be a 100% reliable fix so far.

You will be responsible for all costs Ustream may incur relating to any such information made available by you to the Site and Related Services, including those arising out of any third party claims.

Eligibility and Registration.
You must be at least 18 years of age to use our Subscription Software and Related Services. If you wish to access certain Subscription Software and Related Services, you will be required to create an account.
When you register with Ustream and set up your Subscription Software accounts, you agree to provide Ustream with accurate, true, current, and complete information. You agree to promptly update your information for your Subscription Software account(s) on an ongoing basis. You authorize Ustream, directly or through third parties, to make any inquiries we consider necessary or appropriate to verify your information for your Subscription Software account(s). You agree that you will not use false identities or impersonate any other person or use a username or password that you are not authorized to use.
You are responsible for safeguarding your account administration password(s) and you agree not to disclose your password(s) to any third party. You are solely responsible for any activities or actions taken under your password(s), whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You will immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password. Ustream reserves the right to require you to change your username or password for any reason and at any time.
Modification.
1. Ustream reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify, discontinue or terminate all or a portion of the Subscription Software and Related Services, or to modify these TOS, at any time and without advance notice. If we modify these TOS, we will update the “Last Updated” date at the top of these TOS. If any modified terms and conditions are not acceptable to you, your sole remedy is to cease using the Subscription Software and Related Services. By continuing to access or use the Subscription Software and Related Services after Ustream makes any such revision, you agree to be bound by the revised TOS.
Fees and Payment.
Each of our Subscription Software and Related Services offerings have defined fees for use and overages (collectively, the “Fees”), some of which may be recurring on a monthly, quarterly, annually, or some other period of time. You will have an opportunity to review and accept the Fees and billing cycle for your chosen Subscription Software and Related Services either through our Site or as part of your Sales Order. Ustream reserves the right to change the Fees and/or billing cycles for our Subscription Software and Related Services at any time, but any such changes will only apply prospectively.
All Fees are due in advance of receiving any services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you have a current Sales Order with Ustream your Fees will be invoiced upon you signing your Sales Order and are due and payable within fifteen (15) days of the invoice date, unless otherwise set forth in the Sales Order. Subsequent payments for the services will be invoiced in advance (except for any overages, which will be invoiced monthly in arrears unless otherwise stated) and are due and payable within fifteen (15) days of invoice date or the monthly, quarterly or annual billing date, as applicable. Late payment fees may apply. All invoices will be sent to the billing contact and address information shown on your Sales Order. Unless otherwise set forth in your Sales Order, all Fees are recurring (until terminated) and charged to you regardless whether or not you use the Subscription Software and Related Services. If you choose to enroll in Subscription Software and Related Services that have recurring Fees, you agree that Ustream may automatically charge the recurring Fees to your chosen payment method at the beginning of each billing cycle.
All fees and charges are expressed as exclusive of any Transaction Tax (including, but not limited to value added, goods and services, consumption, sales, use, stamp tax, personal property tax) customs or other duty, tax, or similar levies (collectively “Taxes”). If any Taxes are imposed by any authority on or in connection with your acquisitions under the Agreement, the applicable Taxes will be added to the charges payable by you to Ustream. You will be responsible for, and will promptly pay, all Taxes to Ustream. To the extent that Ustream and you agree that no Transaction Tax is chargeable by Ustream on your acquisition of Subscription Software and Related Services, you warrant to provide Ustream with any required exemption certificates or other applicable documentation or information to evidence the non-charging of Transaction Taxes. 
Where taxes are based upon the location(s) receiving the benefit of the Subscription Software and Related Services, you have an ongoing obligation to notify Ustream of such location(s) if different than the business address that you provided for billing purposes. 
In the event that you provide inaccurate information or fail to update Ustream with any change in status relevant to taxation, you indemnify and hold Ustream harmless against any and all claims by any tax authority for Transaction Taxes, interest and penalties levied as a result of your misinformation. 
You agree to: i) pay withholding tax directly to the appropriate government entity where required by law; ii) furnish a tax certificate evidencing such payment to Ustream; iii) pay Ustream only the net proceeds after tax; and iv) fully cooperate with Ustream in seeking a waiver or reduction of such taxes and promptly complete and file all relevant documents.
The services you order will continue in effect unless and until you cancel your subscription or the account, or service is otherwise suspended or discontinued pursuant to these TOS. You must cancel your subscription at least 30 days before it renews in order to avoid a charge for the next billing cycle. UNLESS OTHERWISE SET FORTH HEREIN OR IN A SALES ORDER, ALL FEES ARE NON-REFUNDABLE.
If you fail to meet your payment obligations, Ustream reserves the right to terminate your relevant Subscription Software account(s), convert your account to a Basic Services Ustream account (upon which advertisements will appear on your User Submissions), charge you an overage or other fees, or take any other action which we deem to be reasonable, and your continued use will be subject to the Terms and Conditions for Basic Services.
Termination and Effect of Termination
Termination by Ustream. Ustream reserves the right to immediately terminate or suspend your account or your access to any or all of the Subscription Software and Related Services and remove any material (including User Submissions (as defined below)) from the Subscription Software and Related Services or our servers at any time with or without cause and without notice. This includes, without limitation, terminating or suspending your account if the charges to your credit card or our Fees are refused or otherwise not paid for any reason. If Ustream terminates all or a portion of your Subscription Software and Related Services prior to the completion of the term of your Sales Order with Ustream for such services stated online or in a Sales Order (“Term”), you are still liable for paying all outstanding Fees and charges incurred prior to termination and your sole remedy against Ustream is a pro-rata refund of the purchase price paid in advance (if any) for the unavailable service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if termination of your account or access to services is as a result of your breach of these TOS or a Sales Order, Ustream will have no liability to you and you will be solely liable for the full amount of any Fees owed and contracted for with us and any outstanding charges relating to your account.
Termination by You. You may terminate your Ustream account(s) at any time and for any reason by contacting us at billing@ustream.tv or, if available to you, selecting “Close Account” in your account preferences. Subscription Software and Related Services Fees are non-refundable and if you choose to terminate your Subscription Software and Related Services prior to the end of the Term (excluding a termination due to non-monetary causes beyond your control that exceeds 30 days). You agree to pay any outstanding Fees contracted for under your Sales Order with Ustream and/or outstanding charges relating to your account.
Effect of Termination. Once your Subscription Software and Related Services account is terminated, and unless otherwise agreed by you and Ustream, your account will be converted to a Basic Services account and your continued use (including the continued hosting of your User Submissions on our servers) will be subject to the Terms and Conditions for Basic Services. Ustream will have no obligation to maintain any information stored in our database related to your account or to forward any information to you or any third party, including User Submissions. Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you by these TOS will immediately cease.

Privacy Policy
Last Updated: December 13, 2010

Ustream, Inc. (“Ustream”, “we” or “us”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of our website accessible at www.ustream.tv (the “Site”) and our proprietary video player platform which enables the sharing of live and recorded video and audio content and chat on the Internet and via computers and mobile devices by our users (any and all of the foregoing (the “Services”). The Services include Ustream’s proprietary embeddable video players, the Ustream channels, our software applications (including any updates, new versions or new releases thereof) including, but not limited to, our viewer, broadcaster and recorder applications.

As used in this policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or touching information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within the United States or internationally.

Information Collection and Use
Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, features and content, to administer your membership and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site. We also may also use your information in order to better understand how our Services are used.

Personally Identifiable Information.

In the course of using the Services, we ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you and administer your account (“Personal Information”). Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, credit card or other billing information, email address and home and business postal addresses. We use your Personal Information mainly to provide the Services and administer your inquiries.
Please be aware that when you register to become a Ustream Member, other users of the Services may be able to see your screen or user name, in addition to any comments or submissions that you post to the Site or submit via the Services. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and that you not use your real name as your screen or user name to the extent that allows others to identify you. If your use of the Services violates or potentially violates Ustream’s Acceptable Use Policy, your Personal Information may be shared with law enforcement and other third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy and subject to all applicable laws.
We also collect the other information that you provide as part of your use of the Services, including via your registration and the administration and personalization of your profile webpage (e.g., without limitation zip code, gender, age and individual preferences) (“Non-Identifying Information”). Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Ustream Users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Services and to analyze and understand how our Services are used.
We also use your Personal Information to contact you with Ustream newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. Ustream Members who agree to the terms and conditions of the Ustream Terms of Service Agreement are given the opportunity to opt-in to receiving such communications from us in the future. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update your “user preferences” information. (See “Changing or Deleting Information,” below.)
Ustream will also share and use your Personal Information with Ustream Asia, and other networks, websites and entities affiliated, owned, controlled and/or connected with Ustream. We will use your Personal Information in compliance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
At times, we may offer special access to pay-per-view or other special promotional events (e.g., live broadcast of concerts), and we may share your Personal Information with those entities and advertisers that are participating in such event. Unless otherwise stated, we will only share your name and email address to the such parties, so you may receive newsletters or promotional materials from such entities.
Surveys and Promotions. From time to time, we may provide you with the opportunity to participate in surveys, contests or sweepstakes (any of these a “Promotion”) via our Services. If you participate in a Promotion we will request certain Personal Information from you. We use the Personal Information you provide to us in these instances to administer your participation in the Promotion. Participation in a Promotion is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.

Log Data. As you use the Services, whether as a Ustream Member or a non-registered user just browsing (any of these, a “Ustream User”), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (“Log Data”). This log data may include information such as your computer’s IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Services and for the Site’s technical administration. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.

Cookies
Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your encrypted registration ID and login password for future logins to the Site as well as display preference settings (such as preferred language). Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Services, to better understand how you interact with the Services and to monitor aggregate usage by Ustream Users and web traffic routing on the Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Services may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Services.

We may also use “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs” or similar means (individually or collectively “Pixel Tags”) in connection with our Services to collect usage, demographic and geographical location data. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel that is ordinarily not visible to users and may be associated with cookies on a user’s hard drive. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns.

Information Sharing and Disclosure
Ustream Members. When you register through the Site and submit your Personal Information to create a profile webpage, Ustream Users will see your “Screen Name” and the month and year you first registered with Ustream (“Required Member Identifiers”). You can choose what other Personal Information you provide as part of your profile (“Other Member Information”) and in some cases you can choose whether to share that information publicly on the Site by making selections via the “user preferences” section of your profile webpage. Providing Other Member Information is voluntary and should correlate with the degree of interaction you want to have with Ustream Users. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information.

Notifications and Following other Ustream Members. Ustream Members can also choose to join a “crowd” of other Ustream Members and follow their favorite Ustream broadcaster. If you choose to follow another Ustream Member, you will provide that Ustream Member with your public Ustream identity. By joining the crowd of another Ustream member, you also opt-in for notifications sent to you within the Ustream platform. You may also be followed outside of the Ustream platform, if you expose and make public your identity, email address and social network identity.

Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information. We may share aggregated information that includes your Personal Information, Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis and demographic profiling and to deliver targeted advertising about other products and services.

Service Providers. We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Services, to provide the Services on our behalf, to perform Site-related services or to assist us in analyzing how our Services are used (each a “Service Provider”). The types of Service Providers we use include, without limitation, those that provide the following types of services: credit card processing, accounting, customer relationship management, website maintenance, notification services, database management and web analytics. These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

SpotXchange. SpotXchange serves ads on the Site and through the Services and collects information about users’ interaction with those ads, as described in the SpotXchange Privacy Policy, located at http://www.spotxchange.com/spx_privacypolicy.html.

Third Party Social Networking Services. As a Ustream Member you can link your account information with certain social networking services (“SNSs”) and broadcast your activities and other data to your friends. In these instances, depending on the “user preferences” you set in your Ustream account, with your permission and on your behalf we will share the information contained in your Ustream account (e.g., Ustream profile page, channel page and any other information you deem public in any content you create on the Site) with the SNS. We also receive certain information (which may include your Personal Information) in accordance with the privacy settings you have set in your SNS account, if any. Other than what we may share with the SNS in connection with your linking of accounts, the personal information a SNS has about you is obtained by the SNS independent of our Services. Other services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other online services you use.

Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement. Ustream cooperates with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Ustream or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.

Business Transfers. Ustream may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. If Ustream becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, reorganization or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice to you before your Personal Information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

Changing or Deleting Your Information
All Ustream Members may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their registration profile by contacting us. If you completely delete all such information, then your account may become deactivated. If you would like us to delete your record in our system, please contact us and we will attempt to accommodate your request. See below for privacy contact information.

Security
Ustream is very concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ reasonable physical, technological, and administrative security measures and attempt to ensure they are applicable under the circumstances. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored Personal Data (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.

International Transfer
Your information may be transferred to and maintained on computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Ustream transfers Personal Information to the United States and processes it there. Your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.

Links to Other Sites
The Services contain links to other websites. If you choose to visit an advertiser by “clicking on” a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third-party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. This Privacy Policy addresses the use and disclosure of information that we collect from you through our Services. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.

Our Policy Toward Children
Ustream does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at Privacy@ustream.tv If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.

If you ever believe that a Ustream User is acting contrary to this Policy, has violated the law or is defrauding, threatening or endangering you, herself or himself or a third party, we urge you to immediately contact the appropriate law enforcement authorities directly for help. We will cooperate with any law enforcement officials or court order requesting or directing us to disclose the identity of anyone broadcasting or otherwise making available any materials that are believed to violate these TOS. Without limiting any other remedies Ustream may have, Ustream may terminate your Ustream account and/or use of the Site and Subscription Software and Related Services, if Ustream becomes aware that you have violated these TOS.

The Ustream Site and Related Services are not designed to comply with any specific governmental regulation or specific security measures. You agree not to input content that may be subject to any such regulations or required additional security measures. You are responsible for all necessary permissions to include the content in the Site and Related Services and you grant Ustream permission to use, store and process the content in the Site and Related Services. The Site and Related Services are not intended for the storage or receipt of any: 1) personal data and other data, the loss of which would trigger a data breach notification requirement, or 2) health information, including without limitation individually identifiable health information as defined under the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended. You will be responsible for all costs Ustream may incur relating to any such information made available by you to the Site and Related Services, including those arising out of any third party claims.

Eligibility and Registration.
You must be at least 18 years of age to use our Subscription Software and Related Services. If you wish to access certain Subscription Software and Related Services, you will be required to create an account.
When you register with Ustream and set up your Subscription Software accounts, you agree to provide Ustream with accurate, true, current, and complete information. You agree to promptly update your information for your Subscription Software account(s) on an ongoing basis. You authorize Ustream, directly or through third parties, to make any inquiries we consider necessary or appropriate to verify your information for your Subscription Software account(s). You agree that you will not use false identities or impersonate any other person or use a username or password that you are not authorized to use.
You are responsible for safeguarding your account administration password(s) and you agree not to disclose your password(s) to any third party. You are solely responsible for any activities or actions taken under your password(s), whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You will immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password. Ustream reserves the right to require you to change your username or password for any reason and at any time.
Modification.
1. Ustream reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify, discontinue or terminate all or a portion of the Subscription Software and Related Services, or to modify these TOS, at any time and without advance notice. If we modify these TOS, we will update the “Last Updated” date at the top of these TOS. If any modified terms and conditions are not acceptable to you, your sole remedy is to cease using the Subscription Software and Related Services. By continuing to access or use the Subscription Software and Related Services after Ustream makes any such revision, you agree to be bound by the revised TOS.
Fees and Payment.
Each of our Subscription Software and Related Services offerings have defined fees for use and overages (collectively, the “Fees”), some of which may be recurring on a monthly, quarterly, annually, or some other period of time. You will have an opportunity to review and accept the Fees and billing cycle for your chosen Subscription Software and Related Services either through our Site or as part of your Sales Order. Ustream reserves the right to change the Fees and/or billing cycles for our Subscription Software and Related Services at any time, but any such changes will only apply prospectively.
All Fees are due in advance of receiving any services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you have a current Sales Order with Ustream your Fees will be invoiced upon you signing your Sales Order and are due and payable within fifteen (15) days of the invoice date, unless otherwise set forth in the Sales Order. Subsequent payments for the services will be invoiced in advance (except for any overages, which will be invoiced monthly in arrears unless otherwise stated) and are due and payable within fifteen (15) days of invoice date or the monthly, quarterly or annual billing date, as applicable. Late payment fees may apply. All invoices will be sent to the billing contact and address information shown on your Sales Order. Unless otherwise set forth in your Sales Order, all Fees are recurring (until terminated) and charged to you regardless whether or not you use the Subscription Software and Related Services. If you choose to enroll in Subscription Software and Related Services that have recurring Fees, you agree that Ustream may automatically charge the recurring Fees to your chosen payment method at the beginning of each billing cycle.
All fees and charges are expressed as exclusive of any Transaction Tax (including, but not limited to value added, goods and services, consumption, sales, use, stamp tax, personal property tax) customs or other duty, tax, or similar levies (collectively “Taxes”). If any Taxes are imposed by any authority on or in connection with your acquisitions under the Agreement, the applicable Taxes will be added to the charges payable by you to Ustream. You will be responsible for, and will promptly pay, all Taxes to Ustream. To the extent that Ustream and you agree that no Transaction Tax is chargeable by Ustream on your acquisition of Subscription Software and Related Services, you warrant to provide Ustream with any required exemption certificates or other applicable documentation or information to evidence the non-charging of Transaction Taxes. 
Where taxes are based upon the location(s) receiving the benefit of the Subscription Software and Related Services, you have an ongoing obligation to notify Ustream of such location(s) if different than the business address that you provided for billing purposes. 
In the event that you provide inaccurate information or fail to update Ustream with any change in status relevant to taxation, you indemnify and hold Ustream harmless against any and all claims by any tax authority for Transaction Taxes, interest and penalties levied as a result of your misinformation. 
You agree to: i) pay withholding tax directly to the appropriate government entity where required by law; ii) furnish a tax certificate evidencing such payment to Ustream; iii) pay Ustream only the net proceeds after tax; and iv) fully cooperate with Ustream in seeking a waiver or reduction of such taxes and promptly complete and file all relevant documents.
The services you order will continue in effect unless and until you cancel your subscription or the account, or service is otherwise suspended or discontinued pursuant to these TOS. You must cancel your subscription at least 30 days before it renews in order to avoid a charge for the next billing cycle. UNLESS OTHERWISE SET FORTH HEREIN OR IN A SALES ORDER, ALL FEES ARE NON-REFUNDABLE.
If you fail to meet your payment obligations, Ustream reserves the right to terminate your relevant Subscription Software account(s), convert your account to a Basic Services Ustream account (upon which advertisements will appear on your User Submissions), charge you an overage or other fees, or take any other action which we deem to be reasonable, and your continued use will be subject to the Terms and Conditions for Basic Services.
Termination and Effect of Termination
Termination by Ustream. Ustream reserves the right to immediately terminate or suspend your account or your access to any or all of the Subscription Software and Related Services and remove any material (including User Submissions (as defined below)) from the Subscription Software and Related Services or our servers at any time with or without cause and without notice. This includes, without limitation, terminating or suspending your account if the charges to your credit card or our Fees are refused or otherwise not paid for any reason. If Ustream terminates all or a portion of your Subscription Software and Related Services prior to the completion of the term of your Sales Order with Ustream for such services stated online or in a Sales Order (“Term”), you are still liable for paying all outstanding Fees and charges incurred prior to termination and your sole remedy against Ustream is a pro-rata refund of the purchase price paid in advance (if any) for the unavailable service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if termination of your account or access to services is as a result of your breach of these TOS or a Sales Order, Ustream will have no liability to you and you will be solely liable for the full amount of any Fees owed and contracted for with us and any outstanding charges relating to your account.
Termination by You. You may terminate your Ustream account(s) at any time and for any reason by contacting us at billing@ustream.tv or, if available to you, selecting “Close Account” in your account preferences. Subscription Software and Related Services Fees are non-refundable and if you choose to terminate your Subscription Software and Related Services prior to the end of the Term (excluding a termination due to non-monetary causes beyond your control that exceeds 30 days). You agree to pay any outstanding Fees contracted for under your Sales Order with Ustream and/or outstanding charges relating to your account.
Effect of Termination. Once your Subscription Software and Related Services account is terminated, and unless otherwise agreed by you and Ustream, your account will be converted to a Basic Services account and your continued use (including the continued hosting of your User Submissions on our servers) will be subject to the Terms and Conditions for Basic Services. Ustream will have no obligation to maintain any information stored in our database related to your account or to forward any information to you or any third party, including User Submissions. Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you by these TOS will immediately cease. Ustream is not liable to you or any third party for any alleged or actual damages, losses, or claims related to the termination of the Subscription Software and Related Services or termination of your use of the Subscription Software and Related Services.
Upgrading or Downgrading Your Account.
You may upgrade or downgrade your Subscription Software and Related Services account if available to you through your Ustream Dashboard, available at http://www.ustream.tv/dashboard, although in some instances, you may need to contact us directly.
Upgrades will be applied retroactively to the beginning of the current billing cycle. Any usage in the current billing cycle will be charged under the new plan rates. At the time you choose to upgrade, you will be charged the difference between your old plan rate and the new plan rate. Your billing date will remain the same as your original billing date.
Downgrades will not take effect until the commencement of the next billing cycle. On your next billing date, you will be charged (if at all) under the new plan rates. You will not be refunded for any unused portion of the current billing cycle. Downgrading your plan may cause loss of features or functionality. Ustream will not be liable to you or any third party for any downgrading and Ustream will have no obligation to maintain any information stored in our data centers related to your account or to forward any information to you or any third party.

General.
Assignment. You will not assign these TOS, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of Ustream. Ustream may assign these TOS or any rights hereunder without your consent.
Relationship of the Parties. Ustream is an independent contractor, not your agent, joint venturer, partner, or fiduciary, and does not undertake to perform any of your regulatory obligations, or assume any responsibility for you or your business or operations.

Business Contact Information; Subcontractors.

Force Majeure. Ustream is not responsible for failure to fulfill its obligations under these TOS due to causes beyond its control, including, but not limited to, extraordinary Internet congestion or extraordinary connectivity issues experienced by major telecommunications providers and unrelated to Ustream infrastructure or connectivity to the Internet, or failure at Ustream co-location facility.
Governing Law. Both parties agree to the application of the laws of the state of New York to these TOS, without regard to conflict of law principles. The rights and obligations of each party are valid only in the country where the transaction is performed or, if we agree, the country where the product is placed in productive use, except all licenses are valid as specifically granted. If any provision of these TOS is invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full force and effect. Nothing in these TOS affects statutory rights of consumers that cannot be waived or limited by contract. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to transactions under these TOS.
Entire Agreement. These Terms of Service are the entire and exclusive agreement between Ustream and you regarding the Site, Content, and Services and supersede and replace any prior agreements between Ustream and you regarding the Site and Services.

Privacy Policy
Last Updated: December 13, 2010

Ustream, Inc. (“Ustream”, “we” or “us”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of our website accessible at www.ustream.tv (the “Site”) and our proprietary video player platform which enables the sharing of live and recorded video and audio content and chat on the Internet and via computers and mobile devices by our users (any and all of the foregoing (the “Services”). The Services include Ustream’s proprietary embeddable video players, the Ustream channels, our software applications (including any updates, new versions or new releases thereof) including, but not limited to, our viewer, broadcaster and recorder applications.

As used in this policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or touching information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within the United States or internationally.

Information Collection and Use
Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, features and content, to administer your membership and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site. We also may also use your information in order to better understand how our Services are used.

Personally Identifiable Information.

In the course of using the Services, we ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you and administer your account (“Personal Information”). Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, credit card or other billing information, email address and home and business postal addresses. We use your Personal Information mainly to provide the Services and administer your inquiries.
Please be aware that when you register to become a Ustream Member, other users of the Services may be able to see your screen or user name, in addition to any comments or submissions that you post to the Site or submit via the Services. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and that you not use your real name as your screen or user name to the extent that allows others to identify you. If your use of the Services violates or potentially violates Ustream’s Acceptable Use Policy, your Personal Information may be shared with law enforcement and other third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy and subject to all applicable laws.
We also collect the other information that you provide as part of your use of the Services, including via your registration and the administration and personalization of your profile webpage (e.g., without limitation zip code, gender, age and individual preferences) (“Non-Identifying Information”). Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Ustream Users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Services and to analyze and understand how our Services are used.
We also use your Personal Information to contact you with Ustream newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. Ustream Members who agree to the terms and conditions of the Ustream Terms of Service Agreement are given the opportunity to opt-in to receiving such communications from us in the future. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update your “user preferences” information. (See “Changing or Deleting Information,” below.)
Ustream will also share and use your Personal Information with Ustream Asia, and other networks, websites and entities affiliated, owned, controlled and/or connected with Ustream. We will use your Personal Information in compliance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
At times, we may offer special access to pay-per-view or other special promotional events (e.g., live broadcast of concerts), and we may share your Personal Information with those entities and advertisers that are participating in such event. Unless otherwise stated, we will only share your name and email address to the such parties, so you may receive newsletters or promotional materials from such entities.
Surveys and Promotions. From time to time, we may provide you with the opportunity to participate in surveys, contests or sweepstakes (any of these a “Promotion”) via our Services. If you participate in a Promotion we will request certain Personal Information from you. We use the Personal Information you provide to us in these instances to administer your participation in the Promotion. Participation in a Promotion is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.

Log Data. As you use the Services, whether as a Ustream Member or a non-registered user just browsing (any of these, a “Ustream User”), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (“Log Data”). This log data may include information such as your computer’s IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Services and for the Site’s technical administration. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.

Cookies
Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your encrypted registration ID and login password for future logins to the Site as well as display preference settings (such as preferred language). Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Services, to better understand how you interact with the Services and to monitor aggregate usage by Ustream Users and web traffic routing on the Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Services may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Services.

We may also use “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs” or similar means (individually or collectively “Pixel Tags”) in connection with our Services to collect usage, demographic and geographical location data. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel that is ordinarily not visible to users and may be associated with cookies on a user’s hard drive. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns.

Information Sharing and Disclosure
Ustream Members. When you register through the Site and submit your Personal Information to create a profile webpage, Ustream Users will see your “Screen Name” and the month and year you first registered with Ustream (“Required Member Identifiers”). You can choose what other Personal Information you provide as part of your profile (“Other Member Information”) and in some cases you can choose whether to share that information publicly on the Site by making selections via the “user preferences” section of your profile webpage. Providing Other Member Information is voluntary and should correlate with the degree of interaction you want to have with Ustream Users. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information.

Notifications and Following other Ustream Members. Ustream Members can also choose to join a “crowd” of other Ustream Members and follow their favorite Ustream broadcaster. If you choose to follow another Ustream Member, you will provide that Ustream Member with your public Ustream identity. By joining the crowd of another Ustream member, you also opt-in for notifications sent to you within the Ustream platform. You may also be followed outside of the Ustream platform, if you expose and make public your identity, email address and social network identity.

Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information. We may share aggregated information that includes your Personal Information, Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis and demographic profiling and to deliver targeted advertising about other products and services.

Service Providers. We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Services, to provide the Services on our behalf, to perform Site-related services or to assist us in analyzing how our Services are used (each a “Service Provider”). The types of Service Providers we use include, without limitation, those that provide the following types of services: credit card processing, accounting, customer relationship management, website maintenance, notification services, database management and web analytics. These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

SpotXchange. SpotXchange serves ads on the Site and through the Services and collects information about users’ interaction with those ads, as described in the SpotXchange Privacy Policy, located at http://www.spotxchange.com/spx_privacypolicy.html.

Third Party Social Networking Services. As a Ustream Member you can link your account information with certain social networking services (“SNSs”) and broadcast your activities and other data to your friends. In these instances, depending on the “user preferences” you set in your Ustream account, with your permission and on your behalf we will share the information contained in your Ustream account (e.g., Ustream profile page, channel page and any other information you deem public in any content you create on the Site) with the SNS. We also receive certain information (which may include your Personal Information) in accordance with the privacy settings you have set in your SNS account, if any. Other than what we may share with the SNS in connection with your linking of accounts, the personal information a SNS has about you is obtained by the SNS independent of our Services. Other services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other online services you use.

Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement. Ustream cooperates with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Ustream or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.

Business Transfers. Ustream may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. If Ustream becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, reorganization or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice to you before your Personal Information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

Changing or Deleting Your Information
All Ustream Members may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their registration profile by contacting us. If you completely delete all such information, then your account may become deactivated. If you would like us to delete your record in our system, please contact us and we will attempt to accommodate your request. See below for privacy contact information.

Security
Ustream is very concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ reasonable physical, technological, and administrative security measures and attempt to ensure they are applicable under the circumstances. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored Personal Data (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.

International Transfer
Your information may be transferred to and maintained on computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Ustream transfers Personal Information to the United States and processes it there. Your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.

Links to Other Sites
The Services contain links to other websites. If you choose to visit an advertiser by “clicking on” a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third-party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. This Privacy Policy addresses the use and disclosure of information that we collect from you through our Services. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.

Our Policy Toward Children
Ustream does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at Privacy@ustream.tv If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.

I must be moving, and it must not be petting this bluetooth keyboard. I don’t think she feels anything for me as a being, particularly - I think my hands are all that truly matters to her. But should this be a problem? Certainly much less so than depending on the habit of beginning sentences with “but.” 

Perhaps that is the way language needs to evolve, but I can’t “stand” for it - a sensation I think I might be beginning to understand, which I certainly did not in all previous youth. It is not necessarily a rational preference. (By that I think I mean: one that I would feel confident rationalizing to you on the spot if you demanded it.) It is somewhat upsetting to find myself in this state - I can imagine it founding much of the mental activity in Western society that grows what we refer to as “hate.” 

In my defense: I think my religion (right now, at least) is dignity. Somehow, this rotting, archaic, elderly process of brain mutation has led me to find beginning sentences with “but” simply unfuckingdignified.","",0,false,MultiMarkdown

If it is a simple diagnosis on the web, the result will be answered within 10 seconds. 

In terms of consumer finance interest rates, it can be said that it shows the performance of loan cashing, and now customers use the comparison site and compare them well enough to borrow at low interest rates.  

It is a natural time to choose.  There are many comparison websites for each consumer finance loan, where details of interest rates that differ by company are summarized for easy comparison.

Since interest points are important points, please try to compare until you are satisfied. If you search for “consumer finance reviews” for a while, you will find a huge number of sites.

Many people are confused about how much they should trust.  Bank-affiliated consumer finance is said to be severely screened, and we will lend only to customers who can lend with confidence.  

On the other hand, consumer lenders who are easy to pass the examination can lend money even to customers who are slightly risky.  

If you can be sure that you can borrow money this month and repay immediately when you get the next salary, you don't have to take into account interest rates anymore.

There are fat consumer finance companies that lend without interest. Many bankers, such as consumer bankers, are now able to accept loans on the same day if the application is completed by 14:00.  

Basically, it can be considered that it takes about two hours for the loan examination. 

If you are a well-known consumer finance company, even if you use the same-day loan in addition to the same-day screening, the loan interest rate will be able to borrow at a low interest rate, so cash with confidence  I think you can.  

Bank-based consumer lenders sell their own screening criteria so that they can lend if possible, so if you fall into a bank card loan review, please apply for a bank-based consumer finance company.  What do you think. ","",0,false,MultiMarkdown
